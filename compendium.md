    > Hello there dearie. I was about to close up shop and run, till you came along. I provide a banking service if you&#39;re interested.&lt;page&gt;Losing one&#39;s Geo is a terrible thing and it&#39;s so much more likely if you carry it about on yourself.&lt;page&gt;My vault is much more secure. In all my time as a banker, I&#39;ve never lost a single Geo!&lt;page&gt;Maybe you&#39;d considered opening an account?
1. BANKER_DREAM_SPA
    > ...Oohh no... Leave me be, creepy little thing...
1. BANKER_CANCEL
    > Changed your mind? Well, come back any time.
1. BANKER_REMEET
    > Have you reconsidered opening an account? Losing Geo is a terrible thing.&lt;page&gt;You&#39;ll be much more confident out there in the big, dangerous world, knowing it&#39;s safe with me.
1. BANKER_WITHDRAW
    > Thanks for the withdrawal. Don&#39;t go spending it all at once!
1. BANKER_BALANCE_ZERO_REPEAT
    > ...I think I might j-j-just rest right here a little while. Yes I think that would be best.
1. BANKER_ACCT_DECLINE
    > I understand. It&#39;s difficult to part with hard won Geo. I&#39;ll be here if you change your mind.

   > It&#39;s rare enough that someone enters my store, but even rarer to meet one so striking!&lt;page&gt;Those impressive horns! That fierce weapon. The air of mystery! Ooooh. It&#39;s enough to make me swoon.
1. CHARMSLUG_COMBO
   > Do you wear a lot of Charms at once? It&#39;s a lot of fun isn&#39;t it, mixing and matching them to get the perfect combination?&lt;page&gt;I don&#39;t know whether you&#39;ve noticed, but some Charms seem to like each other. Yes! Mmm! When Charms like each other, they shine even brighter and sing even more sweetly!&lt;page&gt;Even more reason to try all sorts of fun and surprising combinations of Charms! Mmmmmmm! You&#39;ll show me whenever you have a new favourite, right?
1. CHARMSLUG_MEET_3A
    > Mmm... What were we talking about? Oh yes, Charms! I can see you&#39;ve started your own collection. Very nice! I&#39;ll show you some of my own, and you can take one home with you if you like!
1. CHARMSLUG_MEET_3B
    > Mmm... What were we talking about? Oh yes, Charms! I&#39;m surprised a stylish little gadfly like yourself isn&#39;t wearing any, actually.&lt;page&gt;Charms are gorgeous, mystical, one-of-a-kind accessories with a spark of power woven into their cores. Just wearing one is enough to change your life! You&#39;ll do things you never thought possible!&lt;page&gt;Take a look at some of the Charms I have for sale. You can take one home with you if you like!
1. CHARMSLUG_BLESSING_1
    > My dear. A blessing for you. With your excessive patronage and those startling good looks, you&#39;ve more than earned it. 
1. CHARMSLUG_BLESSING_2
    > Mmmmmm yess... I hope my blessing brings you everything you desire! Don&#39;t be a stranger sweetums.
1. CHARMSLUG_MEET_1
    > Ooooooooooooohhhhhhh, you surprised me! Hello, hello! Come in, sweetling! Come in and make yourself at home.
1. CHARMSLUG_MEET_2
    > I&#39;m Salubra, and this is my cosy little Charm store. Did the townfolk out there tell you to come and visit me? Mmm, yes! This is a lovely little village isn&#39;t it? Warm and intimate and full of life.
1. CHARMSLUG_NOSTOCK
    > Goodness, goodness. You&#39;ve gone and bought all my lovely charms! What a stunning, colourful collection you&#39;ve amassed. Mmmmmm! You&#39;re even more the attractive bug, clad in all those wonderful, sparkling things.&lt;page&gt;I may have nothing more to give, but you must come back and visit from time to time. Such a dashing figure frequenting my store. I bet the whole village is jealous. Mmm hmm!
1. CHARMSLUG_NOTCH_AVAIL_4
    > Mmmmmmmmm! Look at you! Every time I see you, you&#39;ve collected even more Charms! I think it&#39;s about time you bought another Notch so you can wear more Charms at once. Go on... spoil yourself! Mmmm!
1. CHARMSLUG_OVERCHARM
    > It&#39;s a bit of a sin to wear too many Charms at once, isn&#39;t it? Sometimes less is more! Mmmm!&lt;page&gt;Yes, you shouldn&#39;t try to cram on more Charms than you can handle. The effect could be positively overwhelming!
1. CHARMSLUG_TRUTH
    > My dapper gadfly, would you care to know how charms are made? I don&#39;t often tell my customers, what with the truth being a little morbid. But you&#39;re a sharp one so you may have guessed already.&lt;page&gt;Few ways a charm appears but mainly it&#39;s from final wish, a dying bug&#39;s potent desire crystallised into these gorgeous, powerful trinkets.&lt;page&gt;Now don&#39;t go getting too sad. There are exceptions of course, and really, it&#39;s quite beautiful, makes them all the more precious. Mmhhmm.&lt;page&gt;Just think of all the little bug souls that went into creating your collection! It&#39;s like a crowd of strangers in your pouch, or purse, or...err....wherever it is you keep them.
1. CHARMSLUG_NOTCH_AVAIL_1
    > Ooooooooooooohhhhhhh, you&#39;re building up quite the Charm collection, aren&#39;t you? Quite the little connoisseur. I&#39;d bet you&#39;d like to wear more Charms at once, hmm? I&#39;ve got a special item for sale that I think you&#39;ll be very, verrrry interested in! Mmm! 
1. CHARMSLUG_NOTCH_AVAIL_2
    > Oooohhhh! You flamboyant little gadfly! Your Charm collection has expanded quite a bit, hasn&#39;t it? I think it&#39;s about time you bought another Notch so you can wear more Charms at once. Go on... spoil yourself! Mmmm!
1. CHARMSLUG_NOTCH_AVAIL_3
    > Oooohhhh! Your charm collection is getting positively enormous! I&#39;m so jealous! I think it&#39;s about time you bought another Notch so you can wear more Charms at once. Go on... spoil yourself! Mmmm!

1. OUTSKIRTS_BOUGHT
    > Judging by this wall, the city&#39;s folk seemed hesitant to build further into these caverns. I wonder what kept them at bay?
1. CORNIFER_REFUSE
    > Not interested, then? Yes, quite understandable. Exploring without a map, finding your own way through unknown caverns... All very nourishing for the soul.&lt;page&gt;Perhaps we&#39;ll meet again on our travels.
1. OUTSKIRTS_GREET
    > Isn&#39;t this a cosy hole? I&#39;ve been venturing about that wilderness beside here and thought a moment&#39;s break was well called for.&lt;page&gt;The landscape&#39;s all rather serene this side of the city, though the inhabitants are as ferocious as ever.
1. ABYSS_GREET
    > Old caverns these ones. Can&#39;t you just feel the weight of the kingdom above? It&#39;s a heavy thing alright. &lt;page&gt;I reckon not many&#39;d reach these depths. We&#39;re pioneers you and I, at least in recent history.
1. ROYAL_GARDENS_BOUGHT
    > There&#39;s a Stag Station at the heart of these gardens. I would&#39;ve taken my rest there if someone hadn&#39;t gone and locked the door.
1. ROYAL_GARDENS_GREET
    > Have you heard of Hallownest&#39;s Queen? Apparently these gardens were once her retreat.&lt;page&gt;Now some vicious types are crawling all over the place and the plants have grown wild.&lt;page&gt;As inhospitable as it is, I&#39;ve enjoyed my travels here. Care to see my efforts?
1. FOG_CANYON_GREET
    > Ho ho! As odd as much of Hallownest can be, there&#39;s a whole new level of strangeness about these caves.&lt;page&gt;Did you see that dark gate below? It&#39;s quite unsettling to be near. I did my best to avoid it.&lt;page&gt;Fortunate for me, I found another route in, though I did end up a little singed after wading through some acid.
1. CLIFFS_GREET
    > Enjoying the bracing air? We&#39;re quite close to Hallownest&#39;s borders and those desolate plains that surround it. &lt;page&gt;In this direction, I&#39;m about as far as I&#39;m willing to go, though it&#39;s been a pleasant change from the tight confines of the caverns.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve drawn out a small map for the area. It&#39;s a simple one and more for completion really. Not knowing the full extents of a region can be quite frustrating.
1. CORNIFER_AGAIN_DP
    > Y-you want to buy a map after all?
1. CLIFFS_BOUGHT
    > I chanced upon a strange bug atop these cliffs. His house isn&#39;t far from here. &lt;page&gt;A very imposing figure he was and no doubt lethal with a Nail. I suspect you two might share more in common than him and I.
1. CROSSROADS_BOUGHT
    > How are you finding my map? I&#39;ve tried to fill out as much as I can, but every map is a work in progress.&lt;page&gt;If you&#39;d like to fill out some of the map yourself you can purchase some mapping supplies from my wife up in Dirtmouth. We&#39;ve set up a little store to help make ends meet.
1. CITY_GREET
    > Isn&#39;t this a change from those twisting natural caverns? The rain does cast something of a sadness upon it all but the architecture is simply splendid.&lt;page&gt;Charting such a different space is quite the challenge, though one I&#39;ve eagerly undertaken.&lt;page&gt;Perhaps you&#39;d care to purchase a copy of my achievements so far?
1. WATERWAYS_BOUGHT
    > I&#39;d wager these pipes and chambers were once used to carry the city&#39;s waste. Would&#39;ve been a horrid stench down here. Thankfully that constant rain has flushed them clean.
1. FUNGAL_WASTES_BOUGHT
    > There&#39;s a potent odour about these caverns and far worse for me I suspect. My trunk is quite sensitive whereas you don&#39;t seem to possess a scent organ of any kind.&lt;page&gt;Is it that you cannot smell at all?
1. FUNGAL_WASTES_GREET
    > Ahh my short friend, you&#39;ve caught me at the perfect time. I&#39;m just about finished charting these noxious caverns.&lt;page&gt;Very territorial types make their homes within this area. I&#39;d suggest avoiding them where possible.&lt;page&gt;Further below some strange thin creatures gave me quite a scare. They seemed an intelligent bunch.&lt;page&gt;In my youth I&#39;d have braved their caves but I fear my matured physique wouldn&#39;t be able to outrun them were they to turn violent.
1. CORNIFER_MEET
    > Hmm? Ah, hello there. Come down to explore these beautiful old ruins? Don&#39;t mind me.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve a fondness for exploring myself. Getting lost and finding your way again is a pleasure like no other. We&#39;re exquisitely lucky, you and I.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m a cartographer by trade, and I&#39;m working on mapping this area right now. Would you like to buy a copy of my work so far?
1. CORNIFER_MEET_DP
    > Hh-hello. I&#39;m Cornifer. I&#39;m a m-mapper by trade. I&#39;ve tried to chart the dense nest beneath here b-b-but it&#39;s proving too dangerous for a bug like me.&lt;page&gt;Vicious little creatures burst out all o-over the place and the passages are a dark, twisting maze. Even with my good head for direction, I-I-I&#39;ve had enough&lt;page&gt;Unless you&#39;re well prepared, I&#39;d urge you to leave, though if you&#39;re feeling strong enough to descend, would you like to buy m-my meagre map?
1. CORNIFER_ISELDA
    > A map can be a useful thing, but it alone won&#39;t show you where you are. If you&#39;ve not the head for directions, I suggest purchasing a compass from my wife, Iselda.&lt;page&gt;She&#39;s just now opening our new map shop in Dirtmouth, selling all sorts of useful things to wanderers like yourself. She&#39;ll even sell some of my old maps from time to time.&lt;page&gt;I pop back to see her whenever I finish mapping an area. She&#39;s always so excited to see me.
1. CORNIFER_INTRO_1
    > Oh, by the way, I haven&#39;t introduced myself have I? Yes, I should apologise for that. When you spend a lot of time by yourself, with just your own thoughts, you forget the niceties of conversation.
1. CORNIFER_INTRO_2
    > My name is Cornifer, and I&#39;ve always loved exploring the world. Why, when I was first hatched I wandered off immediately, leaving my brothers and sisters and poor mother behind! &lt;page&gt;That&#39;s why as soon as I could I moved to Dirtmouth with my wife. A huge, unending Kingdom to explore right on our doorstep. Who could resist?&lt;page&gt;Anyway, I&#39;ll let you return to your travels. With a little luck, we&#39;ll meet again. Be safe and farewell!1.

1. ABYSS_BOUGHT
    > It&#39;s a long trek back to the shop from here. I&#39;ll be resting my legs a little longer.&lt;page&gt;Not too long though! It won&#39;t do to have Iselda worrying after me.
1. CROSSROADS_GREET
    > Hello again! Still winding your way through these beautiful highways? Just imagine how they must have looked during the kingdom&#39;s height, thick with traffic and bustling with life! I wish I could have seen it.&lt;page&gt;Oh, and I suppose I should ask... are you interested in buying a copy of my map for this area...?
1. CORNIFER_REFUSE_DP
    > N-not interested in the map?

1. GREENPATH_BOUGHT
    > I ran into another traveller as I made my way down here. I tried to call out to her as she dashed past but she barely even glanced in my direction. Not an appreciater of maps like you and I, obviously.
1. WATERWAYS_GREET
    > Ho ho! Aren&#39;t these waterways thrilling? A labyrinth of pipes and tunnels.&lt;page&gt;I couldn&#39;t have asked for a better place to employ my talents. It&#39;s all so orderly, so considered, nothing like the crude irregularity of those caverns.&lt;page&gt;Ahh but so sad, my trunk is telling me those Fungal Wastes are close and I sense my damp adventure may have reached its end. Guess I&#39;ll be calling this map done.
1. CORNIFER_NOT_ENOUGH
    > You don&#39;t have enough Geo? Ah, I understand. I&#39;d give you the map as a gift, but I don&#39;t think my wife would be very happy if I did. &quot;All our food is made of Geo&quot;, as they say1. .

1. MINES_BOUGHT
    > I jabbed myself on one of those crystals back there. Awful sharp they are and all over the place. You&#39;d best watch yourself if you&#39;re heading up.
1. GREENPATH_GREET
    > Isn&#39;t this a contrast from the Crossroads? Such a humid, lively place. The roads twist and turn in the most wonderful ways.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve done my best to chart the area ahead, though I must admit some of the area&#39;s inhabitants proved quite a nuisance.
1. FOG_CANYON_BOUGHT
    > There&#39;s a large building just below here, out in the middle of a lake and a marvel to observe.&lt;page&gt;I tried to head in, but it&#39;s become a nest for those slimey, see-through creatures.&lt;page&gt;Ugh. They&#39;re just so... gross, and they give a nasty shock to touch.

1. ISELDA_GRIMM
    > Have you seen them? The travellers who set up camp outside of town?&lt;page&gt;I was interested at first, not a lot has been happening lately. But they have a... sinister feeling to them. You can feel it, right?&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve told Cornifer he&#39;s not to speak to them. His heart and his mind are a little too open sometimes.

Together, marvels shall be achieved.&lt;page&gt;But don&#39;t fret small one. For this task you won&#39;t travel alone. My child shall guide you to the flame and gather within itself that burning essence.&lt;page&gt;Like you, the child plays key role in this task. Only with it by your side will the flame, and my kin, reveal themselves to you.

She must instead seek them out, must find her love, and free them of their solitude.&lt;page&gt;And thus her own journey began, out into dangerous lands, shielded by her love awaiting, guided by her love to be.&lt;page&gt;With every step, the maiden could feel it, their fated meeting, coming ever closer.

1. BRUMM_LANTERN

Like a strange nostalgia for something that never happened.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve no need for it in any case, so I&#39;m glad you&#39;re enjoying it.
1. IGOR_FINAL
    > ...Mrmm.&lt;page&gt;Very good. The child burns with flame.&lt;page&gt;Master... is waiting for you. Mrmm.
1. PROMPT_FRAGILE_GREED
    > Give Fragile Greed charm?
1. NYMM_FINAL
    > Dear friend, I heard a violent scream from below. Even my song could not mask such a horrible shriek. Was it pain, or rage? I find I&#39;m rather sensitive to such things.&lt;page&gt;If you&#39;re planning to head down, please do stay safe. I&#39;d be dreadfully upset if I forever lost your company.
1. NYMM_DREAM
    > Hmm...Why did I choose to travel here? And how far must I have come... to forget the origin entirely.
1. BRUMM_DEEPNEST_NF_1
    > Mrmm. You came.&lt;page&gt;You have gathered the flame and so the time for the ritual&#39;s completion is upon us. All you must do now is return to the Master...&lt;page&gt;Thus it goes, as it ever has. We are like the notes in an old, old song. You and me. Mrmm.&lt;page&gt;And yet... It is not merely by fortune that we meet here, in the darkest, furthest reaches of the world, where my Master&#39;s scarlet eyes can not see us.&lt;page&gt;Mrmm. A song that never ends... is no song at all.&lt;page&gt;You take part in the Ritual, yet I sense you truly have no Master. Is it so? Perhaps together we can banish that livid flame and let this dead Kingdom rest in peace.&lt;page&gt;If you wish to silence the endless song... Mrmm, meet me where it began...

1. BRUMM_DEEPNEST_2
    > Endless, repeating songs of sacrifice, of servitude. For the Ritual. For the troupe. For the Master.&lt;page&gt;Even this child was born into invisible chains. Mrmm.
1. GRIMMSYCOPHANT_INSPECT
    > The corpse of a large bug.
1. BRUMM_DEEPNEST_4
    > It is done... and yet...&lt;page&gt;It is not merely by fortune that we meet here, in the darkest, furthest reaches of the world, where my Master&#39;s scarlet eyes can not see us.&lt;page&gt;Mrmm. A song that never ends... is no song at all.&lt;page&gt;You take part in the Ritual, yet I sense you truly have no Master. Is it so? Perhaps together we can banish that livid flame and let this dead Kingdom rest in peace.&lt;page&gt;If you wish to silence the endless song... Mrmm, meet me where it began.&lt;page&gt;But if you return to the Master and complete the Ritual... Mrmm. As long as you do it without regret, I will bear you no hatred.

1. DIVINE_REOFFER

1. GRIMM_LEVELUP_1
    > I can feel it. The warmth of the flame you&#39;ve gathered together.
1. GRIMM_LEVELUP_2
    > A masterful opening act. The air hums with excitement.&lt;page&gt;Dear child, you&#39;ve done so well. Let your fire burn even brighter!
1. GRIMM_LEVELUP_3
    > Beautiful, yes. The child has grown, from idle youth to deadly companion. About these dangerous lands, its aid will no doubt be welcome.&lt;page&gt; Just don&#39;t neglect our dance, for it too continues! Keep hunting that scattered, scarlet essence.&lt;page&gt;When the child is filled with flame once more, return to the stage and the performance will begin.
1. DIVINE_FINAL_REPEAT
    > That&#39;s enough. Enough! I&#39;m feeling very happy now.&lt;page&gt;Aaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Now, I can follow Master...
1. DIVINE_GRIMM_DEPARTED

1. BRUMM_DEEPNEST_REPEAT
    > If you wish to silence this endless song, meet me where it began...&lt;page&gt;But if you wish to continue the Ritual... Mrmm. As long as you do it without regret, I will bear you no hatred.
1. DIVINE_CHARM_EQUIPPED
    > Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!&lt;page&gt;That charm... beautiful! Most precious thing! Little lovely, will you let me see it? Have to show it to me!
1. DIVINE_CONVO_1

1. SLY_NYMM
    > Another bug&#39;s arrived. And quite a racket he&#39;s making in the square. Worse, he&#39;s not a Geo to his name! Only that blasted, squealing instrument.&lt;page&gt;Why is it always the poor that decide to stay?
1. GRIMM_MEET1
    > So, it was you who called us.
1. GRIMM_MEET2
    > Well met, my friend. Well met. I am Grimm, master of this troupe.&lt;page&gt;The lantern has been lit, and your summons heeded. A fine stage you choose, this kingdom fallowed by worm and root, perfect earth upon which our Ritual shall take place.&lt;page&gt;And you, my friend. Your own part is far from over.
1. MIDWIFE_WEAVERSONG
    > Ohhhh.. Heehee. Been prying about the weavers&#39; home, have you my dear? Quite brazen to pilfer that special charm.&lt;page&gt;Amazing things the weavers once crafted on their looms; stories, shields, spells. So much of our history was spun upon their spools. Your little friends there are testament to their talents... heehee.&lt;page&gt;Oh! I do apologise. I&#39;ve just felt a rumbling down below, in my belly. Just wait right there a moment. Don&#39;t you move now...
1. BRUMM_LANTERN_DREAM
    > Master... are even you a slave? If so, let our chains be broken together!
1. NYMM_MEET
    > Ah. Hello! Hello! I&#39;m new around these parts, so it&#39;s marvelous to see so friendly a face, in such a sad town.&lt;page&gt;The old bug over there was very welcoming, but still I find the place a little melancholy, what with the wind, and the darkness, and the sense of decline... I was hoping my music could go some way to livening up the place.&lt;page&gt;And now you&#39;ve arrived with that wonderful, charming aura about you. The whole town feels brighter for it.&lt;page&gt;Before you hurry about your business, I&#39;ve a small gift to commemorate a wonderful new friendship. No use for it myself, but I believe it&#39;d look rather fancy upon you.&lt;page&gt;Please, enjoy it, and lets hope to see much more of one another about town.
1. LEG_EATER_GOLD1
    > Eaurgh... Eaaauuurrgggh?!&lt;page&gt;My charm! What did you do to it?! The smell... different. Strange, but nice. Very nice!&lt;page&gt;That smell... talks to me. Someone, somewhere... very nice.
1. DIVINE_REFUSE
    > Eeuuarrggh! Why?!&lt;page&gt;Little lovely, don&#39;t do nasty things. Don&#39;t be cruel. Show it to me! That beautiful thing was made for me... I can smell it!
1. GRIMMSYCOPHANT_DREAM
    > Master... my role.... apart from you... apart from kin. It pains me so.
1. MOTHSTONE_DREAM
    > Protect yourself... You are our last...
1. JIJI_GRIMM
    > Hmm. A fierce host has settled nearby. Did you summon them? I find their smell... unsettling.&lt;page&gt;Theirs is a scent of distant places, unfamiliar even to me.&lt;page&gt;They have a strange look to them, gaudy and intimidating. Perhaps you suspect they hide their true appearance? You&#39;d be right. They favour projection over truth, shrouding themselves in forms dreamed.&lt;page&gt;Best be careful. Assisting them might benefit you, but who knows what suffering it may cause?
1. LEG_EATER_GOLD3
    > Eaurgh... Eaaauuurrgggh!! Eaauurggh!&lt;page&gt;Those charms... that smell! So so much! I want to... yesss!&lt;page&gt;I know where you are now. Above me. Much above me, but I know where to go. I will come! Don&#39;t try to hide from me!
1. ELDERBUG_NYMM
    > Ah ha! Good riddance! That creepy carnival has vanished and town&#39;s returned to its former self, nice and quiet as I like it.&lt;page&gt;And we&#39;ve gained a new addition to the square! I found the fellow just outside of town. Seemed a little confused at first. Claims to be from far away, though he&#39;s hazy on the details.&lt;page&gt;Whatever his past, he&#39;s a rather good musician, and this town&#39;s spent far too long listening only to the wind. Thanks to him, we&#39;ve gained a new tune and some new company!
1. IGOR_DREAM
    > When flame burns bright inside one&#39;s mind  
        Kin heed the call &#39;cross lands and time.
1. ELDERBUG_GRIMM
    > Ahh! Look there! Something strange and sinister has suddenly appeared!&lt;page&gt;Ugh, it fills me with dread. I think it best I try to ignore it.
1. DIVINE_ALL_EATEN
    > Ahhhhh. Such beautiful, special gifts. So lovely!&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m ready now. Very ready!&lt;page&gt;My smell... you&#39;ll carry it with you, then?
1. ELDERBUG_TROUPE_LEFT
    > Ah ha! Good riddance! That creepy carnival has vanished and the town&#39;s returned to its former self, nice and quiet as I like it.&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s quite enough to deal with just the occasional traveller. Whole structures appearing out of nowhere, dreadful music, horrific masks, all far more than one old bug should have to face.

### Dream Witch

Source file: *EN_Dream Witch.bytes*

1. WITCH_REWARD_2B
    > There, the door is open and you can enter the glade beyond it. Listen closely in there and you may hear the utterings of bugs long gone.
1. WITCH_HINT_DREAMPLANT
    > Essence can be found wherever dreams take root.&lt;page&gt;Have you seen them? Those whispering plants that grow all over this old Kingdom? I believe there is one just outside. Why not strike it with your Dream Nail, and see what happens?
1. WITCH_HINT_XERO
    > Sometimes dreams take the shape of those who have passed away. Such dreams are bountiful sources of Essence!&lt;page&gt;You should search carefully near graves and other monuments. Why, I believe I saw an interesting gravestone here in the Resting Grounds.&lt;page&gt;If you do decide to disturb those dreams though, be prepared for a fight...
1. WITCH_GENERIC
    > This kingdom is full of old memories, both beautiful and grotesque. Seek them out, reveal them, and gather Essence.
1. WITCH_QUEST_1
    > Hm. You are still unpracticed in the way of dreams. Collect 100 Essence with the Dream Nail; visit me again and I will share what little wisdom I have.
1. WITCH_QUEST_2
    > You and the Dream Nail both seem a little sharper, but you still have a long way to go. Return to me once you have collected 200 Essence.
1. WITCH_QUEST_3
    > You and the Dream Nail both seem a little sharper, but you still have a long way to go. Return to me once you have collected 300 Essence.
1. WITCH_QUEST_4
    > Ah, you have learnt a lot about wielding the Dream Nail, haven&#39;t you? Return to me once you have collected 500 Essence and I will teach you more.
1. WITCH_QUEST_5
    > Ah, you have learnt a lot about wielding the Dream Nail, haven&#39;t you? Return to me once you have collected 700 Essence and I will teach you more.
1. WITCH_QUEST_6
    > Ahhh, the Dream Nail is glowing so brightly! Keep it up. Return to me once you have collected 1200 Essence.
1. WITCH_QUEST_7
    > Ahhh, the Dream Nail is glowing so brightly! Keep it up, return to me once you have collected 1500 Essence.
1. WITCH_QUEST_8
    > Incredible... the Dream Nail, it is so close to fully awakening! Collect more Essence! Once you have 1800 Essence, something truly marvellous will happen!
1. WITCH_QUEST_9
    > The Dream Nail has fully awoken, yet still you collect Essence. Perhaps I&#39;ve instilled an obsession in you?&lt;page&gt;Keep at it, then! I&#39;m happy to wait and watch your progress.&lt;page&gt;Once you have collected 2400 Essence, return to me. I&#39;ve no more gifts to give... but you&#39;d prove yourself the Wielder my tribe awaited.
1. WITCH_FINAL_3
    > Aahh... I&#39;m sorry...&lt;page&gt;Light... Radiance...&lt;page&gt;I... remember you.
1. WITCH_FINAL_1
    > So much Essence... So bright.... You truly are the Wielder my tribe so long has dreamed of.&lt;page&gt;The folk of my tribe were born from a light. Light similar to Essence, similar to that powerful blade, though much brighter still.&lt;page&gt;They were content to bask in that light and honoured it... for a time.&lt;page&gt;But another light appeared in our world... A wyrm that took the form of a king.&lt;page&gt;How fickle my ancestors must have been. They forsook the light that spawned them. Turned their backs to it... Forgot it even.
1. WITCH_FINAL_2
    > And so this kingdom was born from that betrayal. But the memories of that ancient light still lingered, hush whispers of faith... Until all of Hallownest began to dream of that forgotten light.&lt;page&gt;Ah, but what&#39;s done is done. And so am I. The Wielder has at last appeared and I&#39;ve held the memories of my tribe for long enough. It is time for us to be forgotten too.&lt;page&gt;Don&#39;t remember us, Wielder. Don&#39;t honour us. We do not deserve it...
1. WITCH_DREAM
    > What are you doing, poking about in a dusty old mind like mine? Nothing of worth is hidden inside, believe me.&lt;page&gt;But keep probing the world around you with your Dream Nail... Hidden things will reveal themselves.
1. WITCH_DREAM1
    > What a terrible fate they&#39;ve visited upon you.&lt;page&gt;To cast you away into this space between body and soul.&lt;page&gt;Will you accept their judgement and fade slowly away?&lt;page&gt;Or will you take the weapon before you, and cut your way out of this sad, forgotten dream?
1. WITCH_MEET_A
    > Ahhhh, you&#39;ve returned. Welcome back to the waking world.
1. WITCH_MEET_B
    > Ahhhh, you&#39;ve found your way back to me. When you awoke you just up and left. I thought perhaps I&#39;d frightened you.
1. WITCH_REWARD_8A
    > Yes. The time has come. The Dream Nail... And you as well, Wielder. It is time for you both to awaken.&lt;page&gt;The Essence you have collected...The hope that still remains in this old Kingdom. Pure potential! Let it course through you and into the Dream Nail.&lt;page&gt;Hold it aloft, Wielder! Awaken! 
1. WITCH_REWARD_8B
    > Ahhhh, ah ha, yes...&lt;page&gt;No dream can hide itself from you now. You can peer into the darkest places... You just need to find the right crack.&lt;page&gt;What will you do with such a power, Wielder? Whose memories will you hunt down?&lt;page&gt;Hah. Do as you wish, my promise is fulfilled. May the crimes of my tribe be washed away in time, like the rest of this Kingdom&#39;s...
1. WITCH_DREAM_FALL
    > Though you may fall, your will shall carry you forward.&lt;page&gt;A dream is endless, but a Kingdom is not.&lt;page&gt;The power to wake this world from its slumber... you only need to reach out and take it.
1. WITCH_QUEST_5B
    > My my, you&#39;re almost starting to become a dream yourself! Once you have collected 900 Essence I&#39;ll teach you a trick that I&#39;ve kept hidden for a long time...
1. WITCH_INTRO
    > Those figures, those Dreamers... they reached out with what little power they still have and dragged you into that hidden place.&lt;page&gt;But that talisman you now wield, the Dream Nail... it can cut through the veil that separates the waking world from our dreams. Even the Dreamers themselves can not hide from such a weapon.&lt;page&gt;Though I must admit, that sacred blade has dulled over time. Together perhaps, we can restore its power. You only have to bring me Essence.&lt;page&gt;Essence... the precious fragments of light that dreams are made of. Collect it wherever you find it, and bring it to me. Once we have enough, we can work wonders together.&lt;page&gt;Go out into the world, Wielder. Hunt down the Essence that lingers there!&lt;page&gt;Collect 100 Essence and return to me. I will teach you more...
1. WITCH_GREET
    > Ah, Wielder, you&#39;ve returned. Let me have a look at the Dream Nail...
1. WITCH_REWARD_5B
    > The Dream Nail now holds 900 Essence within its core! Are you surprised that this old kingdom has so many hidden dreams?&lt;page&gt;Yes, you&#39;re starting to see them. The connections between us and the dreams we leave behind, like prints in the dust. The time has come for you to learn how to revisit the places connected to you!&lt;page&gt;Hold the Dream Nail tight, wielder, and imagine a great gate opening before you!
1. WITCH_REWARD_1
    > Hmm, already you&#39;ve collected 100 Essence. Quick work! Things come naturally to you, don&#39;t they?&lt;page&gt;No wonder the Dreamers tried to bury you in that old dream. Perhaps you frighten them? Or perhaps, being prisoners themselves, they desired your company?&lt;page&gt;In any case, you still have a long way to go. Take this old trinket as encouragement from me, and return when you have collected 200 Essence.
1. WITCH_REWARD_3
    > So you&#39;ve collected 300 Essence... Yes, I can see the dreams of this old Kingdom are starting to cling to you. Very encouraging.&lt;page&gt;You&#39;ve certainly made my dreary work here more exciting. Being the caretaker of this place hasn&#39;t been very stimulating.&lt;page&gt;I shouldn&#39;t complain though. Tending these graves and guiding the Wielder... all penitence for old crimes. Certain things have to be kept in balance.&lt;page&gt;Take this trinket for your efforts, and return with 500 Essence. Keep up your tireless work!
1. WITCH_REWARD_4
    > Ahhhhh. 500 Essence. You&#39;re a master in the making. Well done! Well done! I&#39;ve a small reward for you.&lt;page&gt;Plucked from one of my most precious memories, this Charm will bring you and the Dream Nail closer together still. The secrets of this kingdom won&#39;t be able to hide from you any longer!&lt;page&gt;Take it, and return once you have collected 700 Essence. More gifts await you...
1. WITCH_REWARD_5
    > So, you already have 700 Essence. I wonder whether the Dreamers are watching you as you work. Or even that old King.&lt;page&gt;That lock of theirs. Desperate, but very clever. I wonder how long they thought it could hold?&lt;page&gt;I hold no disdain for them though. As history goes on I grow numb to its repetitions.&lt;page&gt;Take your gift and continue collecting Essence. Once you have 900, come back and visit me.
1. WITCH_REWARD_6
    > The Dream Nail glows bright... It holds over 1200 Essence. Looking into it I can see so many memories peering back at me. So many asking to be remembered.&lt;page&gt;None of us can live forever, and so we ask those who survive to remember us.&lt;page&gt;Hold something in your mind and it lives on with you, but forget it and you seal it away forever. That is the only death that matters.&lt;page&gt;Huh, so they say! Enough of that though. Take this relic and come back to me with 1500 Essence. Go!
1. WITCH_REWARD_7
    > Yes, I thought so. More than 1500 Essence. The Dream Nail is close... so close to fully awakening!&lt;page&gt;Continue on your path, Wielder. I know not what guides you, nor what will it is that drives you forward. Once you have collected 1800 Essence though, I will be here waiting.&lt;page&gt;Take this gift, may it grant you strength and help you to collect the Essence of this world!
1. WITCH_REWARD_2A
    > Ahhh... Your Dream Nail holds over 200 Essence. You&#39;re proving your talent in its collection.&lt;page&gt;Have you seen that great door just outside? My tribe closed it long ago and forbade its opening.&lt;page&gt;Ah, but as far as I can tell I&#39;m the only member of my tribe still breathing. That means I needn&#39;t feel bad about breaking a taboo. As proof of my belief in you, I&#39;ll open the door.

12. Our King appears as bug, and I shall take him as so.But his are traits that transcend our kind. His is a mind beyond ours. Deity given form. In sleep, I shall not look upon his like again.
13. That plague, it calls to something within. But that union it offers is a lie, the cost, a mind regressed.
14. We sealed that plague, and thought we&#39;d found an answer, but we were wrong.&lt;page&gt;Our sacrifices... what did they win us? A world sealed in stasis.
15. Remember our promise, sister!&lt;br&gt;We three vowed to protect the seal with all of our devotion.
16. More detached than the other dreamers? Maybe ponders how the Hollow Knight (vessel) feels after all this time. Would he make the same choice again?First few dialogues are very taciturn
17. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Open your minds, brother and sister.&lt;br&gt;Our vow was to protect...but do we? The Vessel weakens.
18. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do you truly wish to break it...?&lt;br&gt;Do you have the strength, or the will...?

1. ELDERBUG_MAP_SHOP_OPEN
    > A young couple&#39;s just recently taken up residence in the house beside the station. Seems they&#39;re running a map shop, which may excite adventurous types like yourself.&lt;page&gt;She&#39;s a tall bug, the wife. I told them to take a larger house, especially given they&#39;re all empty, but they liked the look of that one.&lt;page&gt;The way she has to bend just to get through the door...I wouldn&#39;t put up with it myself.
1. ELDERBUG_FLOWER_REREQUEST
    > You&#39;re still holding onto that exquisite bloom... have you changed your mind? Are you really giving me something so precious?
1. ELDERBUG_INTRO_MAIN
    > The other residents, they&#39;ve all disappeared. Headed down that well, one by one, into the caverns below.&lt;page&gt;Used to be there was a great kingdom beneath our town. It&#39;s long fell to ruin, yet it still draws folks into its depths.&lt;page&gt;Wealth, glory, enlightenment, that darkness seems to promise all things. I&#39;m sure you too seek your dreams down there.&lt;page&gt;Well watch out. It&#39;s a sickly air that fills the place. Creatures turn mad and travellers are robbed of their memories.&lt;page&gt;Perhaps dreams aren&#39;t such great things after all...
1. ELDERBUG_CROSSROADS_INFECTED
    > Ehhh...A sharp sickly smell has started to drift from the well beside town. I&#39;d thought those depths ominous before, now they seem just dreadful.&lt;page&gt;Whatever horrid curse afflicts this ruin, I&#39;d wager it&#39;s grown stronger than ever. 
1. ELDERBUG_HINT_ANCIENT_BASIN
    > Did you know the caverns continue even below the capital? Few have ventured that deep so the details are scant.&lt;page&gt;Those who made it back told of impossibly old structures and roads formed as though the rock itself possessed a will.
1. ELDERBUG_INTRO_NORMAL
    > Ho there, traveller. I&#39;m afraid there&#39;s only me left to offer welcome. Our town&#39;s fallen quiet you see.
1. ELDERBUG_TEMPLE_VISITED
    > Did you visit that temple? A strange building I&#39;ve heard, though I&#39;d never dare the journey myself.&lt;page&gt;The braver among us once went there to pray, said they felt at peace within the walls. After a while, they stopped going. I wonder what changed?
1. ELDERBUG_GENERIC_1
    > There&#39;s something strange about you. I&#39;ve seen all types pass below, but you... You&#39;re almost familiar, though I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve never met before.
1. ELDERBUG_GENERIC_2
    > Feeling tired? That bench may be iron, but I assure you it&#39;s quite comfortable. There&#39;s no better place to collect your thoughts before heading below. &lt;page&gt;Plus I enjoy the company. Not that you seem the talkative sort.
1. ELDERBUG_GOSSIP_HINT
    > It&#39;s a sprawling land beneath us. If you&#39;re ever feeling lost or would care for some direction, come speak with me. I may be able to suggest a new sight or a new path you&#39;d never before considered.&lt;page&gt;Suprised? Despite my lack of experience, I&#39;m actually quite knowledgeable about the lay of the kingdom below. I&#39;ve listened to countless stories from travellers and explorers just like yourself.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have your own grand tale to tell once you&#39;re finished down there. Either that or you&#39;ll be dead! I&#39;ll admit, in Hallownest, the latter is far more common.
1. ELDERBUG_FLOWER_REQUEST
    > Hm? What&#39;s that you have there? Ah! What a beautiful flower!&lt;page&gt;I&#39;d never have guessed by looking, but you have surprisingly good taste in flora. Why are you carrying around such an exquisite bloom?&lt;page&gt;Wait... you didn&#39;t...? Ahh!&lt;page&gt;This flower is... is it a gift? For me? Are you really giving me something so precious?
1. ELDERBUG_STAG_STATION_REOPENED
    > I never thought I&#39;d see such a thing. The Stag Station has opened! That building lay silent since before even my time.&lt;page&gt;Oh, I&#39;ve heard the tales of the glorious lines. A web of tunnels running all through the kingdom. Not that I&#39;ll be travelling them, mind you!&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m quite content where I am.
1. ELDERBUG_BRETTA_RETURNED
    > That lovely young lass returned to us!&lt;page&gt;I must admit, I&#39;d placed thin odds on her survival.&lt;page&gt;Seems to think very highly of her rescuer, some sort of dashing, warrior type. Barely stopped gushing since she got back.&lt;page&gt;The warrior must have passed down below whilst I was taking my nap. Such a shame. I&#39;d have loved to meet so impressive a bug.
1. ELDERBUG_FLOWER_ACCEPT
    > Ah! I can really have it? My, my... I barely know what to say except... thank you!&lt;page&gt;I&#39;d resigned myself to selflessly giving out advice to passers by, without receiving any gratitude in return. Little did I know, one young bug was taking my words to heart and would repay my kindness.&lt;page&gt;And with such a beautiful gift! Ahh. Suddenly, the world seems a little less faded.&lt;page&gt;Thank you, my friend. I will take care of this flower while you&#39;re gone, so we can enjoy it together when you return.
1. ELDERBUG_HINT_FUNGAL_WASTES
    > My understanding of Hallownest can be a little vague, but below those leafy caverns is a fungal grove, once home to peaceful creatures not quite bug and not quite plant.&lt;page&gt;Sounds almost worth a visit no? Well there&#39;s a downside, the dreadful stench! A noxious odour fills the place. 
1. ELDERBUG_FLOWER_DECLINE
    > Oh. My mistake. Yes. Very foolish of me. I don&#39;t know why I thought you&#39;d go to so much effort for a simple old bug.&lt;page&gt;Appreciating others and being considerate... these aren&#39;t skills that everyone is born with.
1. ELDERBUG_SHOPKEEP_RETURNED
    > Oh, what a turn! Our shopkeep&#39;s come home. Just wandered back in. I&#39;d hoped for grand tales of his time below, but he seems to remember almost nothing! Maybe it was all too much for him?&lt;page&gt;If you&#39;re interested in his wares, watch out! He drives a hard bargain, that one.&lt;page&gt;No competition. That&#39;s the problem. It&#39;s bad for the market. Not that he&#39;s complaining.
1. ELDERBUG_DREAM_FLOWER
    > These petals... so white. Can you see them too... watching me from wherever you are?&lt;page&gt;Perhaps dreams aren&#39;t such bad things after all...
1. ELDERBUG_HINT_GREENPATH
    > I used to think the kingdom below was all dead cold rock, but I&#39;ve since been told different. Travellers speak of startling variety in Hallownest&#39;s caverns. Even just besides those Crossroads there&#39;s meant to be an area filled with leafy greenery.&lt;page&gt;I told those same travellers about the wonderful grasses that grow around the town. They didn&#39;t seem impressed. 
1. ELDERBUG_HISTORY_1
    > Many used to come, hoping the kingdom would fulfill their desires. &lt;page&gt;Hallownest, it was once called. Supposedly the greatest kingdom there ever was, full of treasures and secrets.&lt;page&gt;Hm. Now it&#39;s nothing more than a poisonous tomb full of monsters and madness.&lt;page&gt;Everything fades eventually, I suppose.
1. ELDERBUG_HISTORY_2
    > I hope you aren&#39;t too disappointed by our little town, traveller. Though it&#39;s now a solemn place, once we were much more welcoming.&lt;page&gt;Entry to the kingdom was forbidden long ago, supposedly after some great calamity. Many gates were closed, but our old well remains as a way to creep back in.&lt;page&gt;Over the years, all kinds used the well to wriggle into the ruins, wanderers, thieves, adventurers.&lt;page&gt;Funny how few ever come back up. Perhaps they find what they&#39;re looking for?..&lt;page&gt;Bah, I&#39;m not so naive. No doubt, they&#39;ve all been gobbled up! There are countless dangers in those depths.
1. ELDERBUG_INTRO_VISITEDCROSSROAD
    > Oh! You&#39;re back! You walked straight past me and descended down into the ruins without even saying hello! I thought maybe I&#39;d seen a ghost.&lt;page&gt;The mind sometimes plays tricks on you when you spend a lot of time alone.
1. ELDERBUG_HINT_RESTING_GROUNDS
    > Apparently, the many graves of Hallownest are enough to fill an entire network of caverns. Somewhere above the city it&#39;s told. Sounds a gloomy sight.&lt;page&gt;Bah, I&#39;m content with our own humble plot. In our boom times, we even had a gravedigger! Not a bad sort he was, though dead now.&lt;page&gt;He, didn&#39;t die to the dangers of Hallownest mind you. That one fell into an open grave and couldn&#39;t climb out.&lt;page&gt;I found the corpse myself. Dreadful nuisance. I&#39;ve since had to tend the graves myself.
1. ELDERBUG_FLOWER_GENERIC
    > This flower you gave me... when dark thoughts creep into my head I gaze at it and think of you.&lt;page&gt;Why not rest at the bench here for a while? We can enjoy the flower together before you head off again.
1. ELDERBUG_INTRO_WALKEDBY
    > Oh! You came back! You walked straight past me, I thought maybe I&#39;d faded away along with this town.
1. ELDERBUG_STAG_STATION_GREET
    > There’s something about you little traveller. The winds are changing.
1. ELDERBUG_MINES_LIFT
    > That noisy old lift, where does it go? Up to the old mines they carved into the peak, I suppose.&lt;page&gt;Have you been up there? Is it true that crystals grow everywhere you step?&lt;page&gt;A villager brought some of those crystals back to the village once. I don&#39;t quite understand the allure myself.&lt;page&gt;You can&#39;t eat them, and they don&#39;t make very good pillows. They hardly seem worth all the trouble to me.
1. ELDERBUG_TOWN_GREET_4
    > If you do meet my fellows down there you might remind them of their poor Elder, up here, back aching, abandoned to his lonesome vigil. Poor poor me!...&lt;page&gt;Oh I&#39;m fine, really, but a bit of guilt might go some way in persuading their return. Assuming they&#39;re still alive that is.
1. ELDERBUG_BLACK_EGG_OPENED
    > I heard a piercing cry from the well. It echoed about my mind and left me all a daze.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;d say it was a foul beast&#39;s death, but this cry sounded different...divine? Has something happened little traveller?&lt;page&gt;No. Don&#39;t tell me. If foul events are brewing, it&#39;s probably better I don&#39;t know.
1. ELDERBUG_DREAM
    > To descend into that ruin...Why? Things are so much simpler up here.
1. ELDERBUG_DUNG
    > Can you... smell something? There&#39;s suddenly a horrid stench in the air.&lt;page&gt;I swear, the town usually smells much nicer than this. Please accept my humble apology!
1. ELDERBUG_JIJI_DOOR
    > Faring well in your adventures below? Well I had an adventure of my own while you were gone.&lt;page&gt;I don&#39;t usually visit the town&#39;s graveyard, but I thought I&#39;d go and visit the grave of an old friend.&lt;page&gt;As I was walking amongst the tombstones, I noticed a strange kind of chanting coming from somewhere nearby. Extremely sinister chanting!&lt;page&gt;I looked around to find the source, and I saw two bright, horrible, huge eyes staring at me from the door of a dark cave!&lt;page&gt;I pretended I hadn&#39;t heard the voice or seen the eyes and scurried back to town. My friend will have to wait a little longer for her visit...
1. ELDERBUG_HINT_CRYSTAL_PEAK
    > Did you see that tall cliff beyond the town&#39;s graveyard? That&#39;s only the base of a much larger peak.&lt;page&gt;There&#39;s mines and machinery and all sorts of valuable rock forms inside. Many a traveller through Dirtmouth headed straight for it.
1. ELDERBUG_TOWN_GREET_3
    > Feeling tired? That bench may be iron, but I assure you it’s quite comfortable. There&#39;s no better place to collect your thoughts before heading below.&lt;page&gt;Plus, I&#39;d enjoy the company, even if you&#39;re not the most talkative sort.
1. ELDERBUG_KINGS_PASS
    > To reach Dirtmouth, most travellers take circuitous routes around the cliffs beside us. It&#39;s a hard trek now but in the kingdom&#39;s prime things were far simpler.&lt;page&gt;There&#39;s an old pass in the cliffs that once allowed easy access. The bridge up to it has long since crumbled away, and even without it, a huge door bars entry.&lt;page&gt;I can&#39;t complain mind you. It&#39;s meant we&#39;ve only ever had to accommodate a trickle of travellers, even during our busiest times.&lt;page&gt;I wouldn&#39;t want hordes of bugs to descend on Dirtmouth. I like the quiet.
1. ELDERBUG_HINT_CITY_OF_TEARS
    > Hallownest&#39;s great capital is what most of you brave types come to see. Thinking to loot its treasures I suppose? It must be brimming with them.&lt;page&gt;The city&#39;s right at the centre of the kingdom, though I&#39;ve heard the gates are sealed, so gaining entry can be difficult.&lt;page&gt;It&#39;d be a rich bug that could return with even a fraction of the wealth inside. Despite my age, I&#39;ve only seen few who&#39;ve managed it. Must say something of the dangers about its streets.

We&#39;re about to set off ourselves, though we can&#39;t seem to agree on which way to head.&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s led to something of an argument between us. We should really stop squabbling about such petty things. 
1. GRAVEDIGGER_REPEAT
    > Do as you will little wanderer. Cut a path toward your goal.&lt;page&gt;I shouldn&#39;t complain. It&#39;s your kind that keeps folks like me in business.
1. FALSE_KNIGHT
    > I wanted it.... the strength to protect the others...&lt;page&gt;When I saw that Knight... sleeping... safe in his big armoured shell...&lt;page&gt;It wasn&#39;t madness that drove me to it... I just wanted it...&lt;page&gt;But... in the end? If strength cannot save you, then what can...?
1. KCIN_TALK
    > I was once obsessed with power though my time within this glade has shed me of such desire.&lt;page&gt;What folly it was to ever crave such a vicious thing. 
1. CASPIAN_REPEAT
    > Do you think dark thoughts little one? When hidden behind a visage as impassive as your own, I find it hard to tell.
1. MARISSA_REPEAT
    > Even if only you, it&#39;s a wonderful thing to have an audience again.
1. NOEYES_REPEAT
    > Precious children, a monster has come for us in the dark...Will you sing for me?
1. THISTLEWIND_TALK
    > Ahhh, a wanderer.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve been many places and done a great many things, but I suspect you will outdo me by far.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve long ceased travelling the caverns of Hallownest and I suspect they&#39;re now far more dangerous than in my journeys, though with your capable air I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll do fine.&lt;page&gt;Good luck! It&#39;s a vast world out there.
1. 100NAIL_TALK
    > Do you like my nails little wanderer? I carry only three, far less than legends may suggest.&lt;page&gt;Still! Each is sharper than the last and I&#39;d require only one to cut you down. 
1. GRASSHOPPER_REPEAT
    > Left or right? Which way is best? It should be a simple thing, yet we&#39;re always at odds.  
1. GROHAC_REPEAT
    > These husks around my neck? They&#39;re my precious friends, always there to keep me company and much better for conversation than the rest of the odd lot around here.
1. JONI_TALK
    > Ahhh, I see you bear my blessing. I can&#39;t remember giving it, but my memory has been a little lacking of late.
1. MARKOTH_DEFEAT
    > Never... have I been defeated in combat.&lt;page&gt;I can... see myself there, still sleeping. How long have I been hidden here?&lt;page&gt;Here at the edge of the world, no-one could find me... except you.&lt;page&gt;Warriors, knights, kings, even time itself... they have no power over me. Only you.&lt;page&gt;You are the darkness... come to consume me.
1. WALDIE_REPEAT
    > You wouldn&#39;t have the guts to face me anyway.
1. HIVEQUEEN_TALK
    > Small thing. I know your kind.&lt;page&gt;If you attempt to resolve your past then know I am not the queen you seek.&lt;page&gt;It is the pale beings that bear blame for your nature.&lt;page&gt;Though this hive exists within Hallownest, we play no part in its attempt at perpetuation.
1. MOLTEN_TALK
    > Don&#39;t fear my rotting form. Though my body sheds and changes my core remains the same.
1. BOSS_REPEAT
    > You too are a warrior? I see your nail, but your shell seems underdeveloped. In your current state, to travel a land as dangerous as this seems unwise.
1. GROHAC_TALK
    > We&#39;re always left with reminders of the errors we&#39;ve made. Let your mistakes not burden you, but serve as guideposts on where not to travel.
1. 100NAIL_REPEAT
    > Aren&#39;t my nails the most wonderful things? Their gleaming blades so sharp and deadly. 
1. GALIEN_REPEAT

1. MUMCAT_TALK
    > Oh! The Queen! The Queen is coming! I&#39;ve been waiting so long, and now she&#39;s almost here! I feel like I&#39;m about to burst!&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve kept it safe, this sacred garden! I&#39;ve kept it safe for all this time, and soon the Queen will return and teach me to fly!&lt;page&gt;Shall we wait together, stranger? Shall we play together?
1. ALADAR_TALK
    > I am Gorb!&lt;page&gt;Bow! Bow bow bow bow to Gorb!&lt;page&gt;The great mind! I am Gorb!&lt;page&gt;Ascend! Ascend! Ascend ascend ascend with Gorb!
1. MARKOTH_REPEAT
    > Raise your weapon then, fool, and die like those who came before you.
1. POGGY_REPEAT
    > I&#39;ve been waiting an awfully long while. Surely it&#39;s dinner time soon?
1. MARISSA_TALK
    > Welcome to my stage little one. I am Marissa, a songstress of some renown, though given the sorry state of this place, you may find it hard to believe. &lt;page&gt;Huge crowds once flocked to hear me sing, then something changed. The audience, once so enrapt, began to leave. I continued to sing yet my voice fell silent upon their ears.&lt;page&gt;Perhaps you&#39;d care to listen to me sing? You&#39;ll be the first in an age to hear it.
1. MARKOTH_TALK
    > You have come a long way, just to die here at the edge of the world.&lt;page&gt;No, do not speak. I have heard thousands and thousands of empty words from those like you. Your pride, your desires, your desperation... you will take these things with you once I strike you down.&lt;page&gt;Raise your weapon then, and die like those who came before you.
1. CHAGAX_TALK
    > I used to help others. They were brought to me sick and dying... What difference did it make?...&lt;page&gt;Any victory against death will always be temporary.
1. MAGNUS_TALK
    > All of life&#39;s problems can be solved with crushing force. Such a simple mantra and one I&#39;ve always lived by.&lt;page&gt;If you weren&#39;t so scrawny, I&#39;d suggest you follow my example.
1. HIVEQUEEN_REPEAT
    > To rail against nature is folly. All things must accept an end. 
1. KARINA_REPEAT
    > You don&#39;t seem to bear the markings of rank, though you bear no markings of a lower form.&lt;page&gt;What are you? Do tell me. Are you a higher being or just another lowly grub? 
1. KCIN_REPEAT
    > Seeking power is a hollow goal. Best to search for other things.
1. ATRA_TALK
    > Don&#39;t fear little creature. Though a violent rage once possessed me the peaceful air in this place seems to keep it at bay. 
1. PERPETOS_REPEAT
    > You&#39;re very impressive for such a small thing. I&#39;m something of a warrior myself, though even I&#39;d hesitate to raise my nail against you.
1. GALIEN_TALK
    > Hoh, a fellow warrior, out here? I thought I was the only one brave enough and strong enough to survive in this foul, forgotten pit.&lt;page&gt;I am Galien, the strongest warrior in Hallownest! I came to this monstrous place to test my strength. No doubt you wish to test your might as well, hmm?&lt;page&gt;Yes, you and I are a rare breed, quite unlike this poor fellow who has fallen before us. The world is not kind to the weak, I fear.&lt;page&gt;So then... shall we do battle? Let us test our strength in joyful combat!
1. HU_REPEAT
    > Beware dreams of glory, child. Turn back, and do not return.
1. NOEYES_TALK
    > My child... can you still see? Please, don&#39;t hurt me.&lt;page&gt;Can&#39;t sleep... with your eyes open, little one. Can&#39;t dream... if you&#39;re still breathing, little one.&lt;page&gt;Precious children... you speak such loathsome things as you sleep... your claws scratch and scrape...&lt;page&gt;Precious children, a monster has come for us in the dark...Will you sing for me?
1. MAGE_LORD
    > In my dreams I could see it. The Kingdom&#39;s salvation, the cure for the plague... the answer was in the soul that animates our bodies.&lt;page&gt;But the King... why?! He opposed everything I did...&lt;page&gt;His jealousy... his madness... by standing against me he robbed me of my immortality!&lt;page&gt;Now the King and his Kingdom are dead... but I... will live forever.
1. HU_INSPECT
    > We remember the Elder.
1. REVEK_TALK
    > The bugs within this glade are under my watch. Treat them with respect and you may remain, but raise your nail and you&#39;ll contend with me.
1. ALADAR_REPEAT
    > Ascend! Ascend! Ascend ascend ascend with Gorb!
1. ALADAR_DEFEAT
    > I... am Gorb!&lt;page&gt;The great mind... the pain! Ascend! Ascend!&lt;page&gt;I... I am...
1. XERO_TALK
    > Stop there! Those who try to leave this kingdom are cursed. Better to rest here, until time itself sleeps.&lt;page&gt;Hope and freedom. I thought that strength alone could grant me these things. In my dreams I would cut that plague with my nails, and then I turned my weapons upon the King.&lt;page&gt;When I awoke in this sacred place, I began to understand. Those who hope are already doomed.&lt;page&gt;Do you still hope, wanderer? Will you flee? Or will you raise your weapon and doom us both?
1. WALDIE_TALK
    > Don&#39;t judge me by appearance. Though my stature is small, I bear a dark soul and a tendency to go berserk in battle.
1. GALIEN_INSPECT
    > The body of a fallen warrior.
1. MUMCAT_INSPECT
    > Protector of root and leaf, we honour you.
1. GALIEN_DEFEAT
    > Unbelievable... I am defeated at last! So this is what it feels like to be bested...&lt;page&gt;Still though, I am strong, am I not? When you see our King, surely you&#39;ll tell him of my valour...?&lt;page&gt;Yes... he sent you here to test me, didn&#39;t he? I knew he had not forgotten brave Galien.&lt;page&gt;I am ready... to join you now. Brothers, you and I. Let us leave this place...&lt;page&gt;...together...
1. HU_TALK
    > Wait, child! Why have you come here? Have you come to tame this savage, ruined land?&lt;page&gt;Many have come to purify this place, but all who dwell here are eventually consumed.&lt;page&gt;Yes, even the wild bugs lurking below us. They were once proud like you, but now they are only monsters.&lt;page&gt;Beware dreams of glory, child. Turn back, and do not return.
1. WYATT_TALK
    > Watch out!&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve an acidic touch and I wouldn&#39;t want you getting burned. It&#39;s a protection system of my kind, though something of a nuisance when it comes to meeting others.
1. HEX_TALK
    > &quot;I&#39;ll see you soon,&quot; she said, though that was long ago. I wonder where she went?
1. XERO_REPEAT
    > Do you still hope, wanderer? Will you flee? Or will you raise your weapon and doom us both?
1. JONI_REPEAT
    > Isn&#39;t it just so peaceful here? Such a perfect place to rest.
1. BOSS_TALK
    > I came from far away to reach this place. Though my shell may seem foreign, beneath it I am a bug the same as you.
1. HEX_REPEAT
    > Go bother someone else. You&#39;re not the one I&#39;m waiting for.
1. XERO_DEFEAT
    > Ah... I can see now. Those who turn against the King are doomed as soon as they raise their weapon.&lt;page&gt;Do not call me a traitor. Simply call me a fool.&lt;page&gt;I know you will not flee. Wherever you go... I will be watching.
1. WAYNER_TALK
    > Hark, fellow adventurer! Are you heading out into the world? I&#39;d join you, but it&#39;s been so long, I fear I&#39;d lose my head.
1. WYATT_REPEAT
    > Don&#39;t get too close. I&#39;d not wish to cause any harm.

1. HORNET_SPIDER_TOWN_01
    > So you&#39;ve slain the Beast... and you head towards that fated goal.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;d not have obstructed this happening, but it caused me some pain to knowingly stand idle.&lt;page&gt;...What? You might think me stern but I&#39;m not completely cold.&lt;page&gt;We do not choose our mothers, or the circumstance into which we are born. Despite all the ills of this world, I&#39;m thankful for the life she granted me.&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s quite a debt I owed. Only in allowing her to pass, and taking the burden of the future in her stead, can I begin to repay it.
2. HORNET_DOOR_UNOPENED
    > I&#39;m impressed little ghost. You&#39;ve burdened yourself with the fate of this world, yet you still stand strong.&lt;page&gt;To break the Dreamer&#39;s seals would alone be considered an impossible task, but to accept that void inside yourself, that casts you as something rather exceptional.
3. HORNET_SPIDER_TOWN_DREAM
    > ...Mother... Forgive my inaction... but another path may be possible...
4. HORNET_OUTSKIRTS_1
    > So you&#39;d pursue the deeper truth? It isn&#39;t one the weak could bear.
5. HORNET_OUTSKIRTS_2
    > Prove yourself ready to face it. I&#39;ll not hold back. My needle is lethal and I&#39;d feel no sadness in a weakling&#39;s demise.&lt;page&gt;Show me you can accept this Kingdom&#39;s past and claim responsibility for its future. 
6. HORNET_PRE_FINAL_BATTLE
    > The path is opened. One way or another an end awaits inside.&lt;page&gt;I won&#39;t be joining you in this. That space is built to sustain your likes. Its bindings would drain me were I to join.&lt;page&gt;Don&#39;t be surprised. I&#39;ll not risk my own life in your attempt, though if the moment presents I&#39;ll aid as I&#39;m able.
7. HORNET_FINAL_BOSS
    > Do it! Make your choice. My thread will only hold so long.&lt;page&gt;Prolong our world&#39;s stasis or face the heart of its infection.
8. HORNET_ABYSS_ASCENT_01
    > Ghost. I see you&#39;ve faced the place of your birth, and now drape yourself in the substance of its shadow.&lt;page&gt;Though our strength is born of similar source, that part of you, that crucial emptiness, I do not share.&lt;page&gt;Funny then, that such darkness gives me hope. Within it, I see the chance of change.&lt;page&gt;A difficult journey you would face, but a choice it can create. Prolong our world&#39;s stasis or face the heart of its infection. 
9. HORNET_GREENPATH
    > Come no closer, ghost.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve seen you, creeping through the undergrowth, stalking me.&lt;page&gt;This old kingdom... A terrible thing awakens. I can smell it in the air...&lt;page&gt;I know what you are. I know what you&#39;d try to do. I can&#39;t allow it.
10. HORNET_ABYSS_DREAM
    > ...It faced the void, and ascends unscathed... Could it unite such vast darkness?..
11. HORNET_SPIDER_TOWN_REPEAT
    > Leave me now, ghost. Allow me a moment alone before this bedchamber becomes forever a shrine.
12. HORNET_ABYSS_REPEAT
    > I&#39;d urge you to take that harder path, but what end may come, the decision rests with you.
13. HORNET_INSPECT_IK
    > The remains of a wanderer, long deceased.
14. HORNET_PRE_FINAL_BATTLE_REPEAT
    > Ghost of Hallownest, you possess the strength to enact an end of your choosing. Would you supplant our birth-cursed sibling, or would you transcend it?
15. HORNET_PRE_FINAL_BATTLE_DREAM
    > ...Could it achieve that impossible thing? Should it?
16. HORNET_OUTSKIRTS_DEFEAT
    > ...So strong...&lt;page&gt;You could do it, if you had the will.&lt;page&gt;But could you raise your nail once knowing its tragic conception? And knowing yourself?...&lt;page&gt;Then do it, Ghost of Hallownest! Head onward. Burn that mark upon your shell and claim yourself as King.
17. HORNET_FOUNTAIN_1
    > Again we meet little ghost.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m normally quite perceptive. You I underestimated, though I&#39;ve since guessed the truth.&lt;page&gt;You&#39;ve seen beyond this kingdom&#39;s bounds. Yours is resilience born of two voids.&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s no surprise then you&#39;ve managed to reach the heart of this world. In so doing, you shall know the sacrifice that keeps it standing.

1. GOT_MARK
    > You have my mark, and you shall be recognised as one of my rare caste. Fellow Hunter, I have nothing else to give you.
1. HUNTER_ENTRIES_COMPLETED
    > So, you&#39;ve encountered all of the beasts in this land. Impressive! But one task remains, little squib.&lt;page&gt;Keep hunting down creatures until you have deciphered all of my notes! Only then will I recognise you as my fellow Hunter and you shall receive your reward.
1. HUNTER_CONVO_1
    > Little squib! You may have overcome a few creatures, but you are only just beginning.&lt;page&gt;Don&#39;t delay, descend into the belly of this world and hunt down the life you find!
1. HUNTER_CONVO_2
    > Ahhh... I knew I&#39;d seen it right. That hunter&#39;s quality. Hallownest&#39;s creatures fall in your path.&lt;page&gt;Don&#39;t stop now little squib, many more there are to find, and stalk, and kill. 
1. HUNTER_CONVO_3
    > Ah ha! Your journal grows fat and full. Only those last few, rare beasts remain left to stalk.&lt;page&gt;Search the kingdom&#39;s corners. Complete the journal. Earn your well deserved reward...
1. HUNTER_COMPLETE
    > Your journal... let me see it!&lt;page&gt;Yes... Yes! The Hunter&#39;s journal is complete!&lt;page&gt;You have proven yourself a true hunter, a master of killing, and so with great pleasure I will give you the reward you deserve...
1. COMPLETE_REPEAT
    > You have proven yourself a true hunter, a master of killing, and so with great pleasure I will give you the reward you deserve...
1. GOT_REVISIT
    > Fellow Hunter. You return? You&#39;ve already proven yourself to me. I&#39;m only biding time a moment, before next my hunt begins.&lt;page&gt;A true Hunter has no home, no kingdom and I&#39;m eager for new prey.&lt;page&gt;You bear the mark now, but that&#39;s only the beginning. That mark will become a part of you, will engrave itself deep within, and that yearning to hunt... It will never leave.
1. HUNTER_MEET
    > Tiny squib... You approach fearless. Are you a hunter like me?&lt;page&gt;Do you feel the urge inside, to stalk, to kill, to understand?&lt;page&gt;Then take it! My journal. It will aid you. At first the text may seem difficult to discern, but a learned hunter will come to understand its words.&lt;page&gt;Venture the depths of this land and slay its beasts. Prove yourself worthy to bear the mark of Hunter.

1. ISELDA_GREET1
    > Of all the places to end up, we&#39;ve picked this dreary town. I&#39;d thought it a temporary stop, then my husband became obsessed with that old ruin.&lt;page&gt;Now he&#39;s spending all his time down there. He argues cartography is sound business, but other than you, who&#39;s buying?
1. ISELDA_TRAMPIN
    > Apparently Hallownest has giant metal carriages called trams? Sounds unecessary to me, given those old stag lines that Corny always talks about.&lt;page&gt;Still, I&#39;ve made a pin to represent a tram station. Might be useful if you&#39;re inclined to make your map more detailed.&lt;page&gt;It wasn&#39;t too hard to make, so I&#39;m not charging a premium for it.
1. ISELDA_NOSTOCK
    > After more supplies? You&#39;ve already bought so much. Unfortunately for now, you&#39;ve cleaned us out of anything worth selling.&lt;page&gt;Cornifer will no doubt be pleased, though I do wonder what he plans to spend all that Geo on. 
1. ISELDA_NEW_MAP
    > ISELDA_NEW_MAP
1. ISELDA_DREAMTREE
    > My husband mentioned some strange roots that grow about the kingdom and suggested I make a pin to mark them.&lt;page&gt;Cornifer thinks my pin&#39;s depiction look grander than the sad limp thing he comes across, but I figure, that&#39;s not a bad thing. Who&#39;d want to buy a pin of a limp root?
1. ISELDA_CORNIFER_HOME
    > Cornifer&#39;s home at last, but look at him, he&#39;s exhausted. He always does this, furiously charts a place, then collapses once he&#39;s done.&lt;page&gt;He&#39;ll be sleeping for some time I imagine, so even with him home, I&#39;m still lost for company.&lt;page&gt;Ahhh, but I do love the bug, even his faults. Seeing his passion for maps, it&#39;s something of an inspiration.&lt;page&gt;Corny keeps asking me to join him on his adventures and I&#39;ve always declined. Maybe next time I should accept the offer?
1. ISELDA_MEET
    > Come to buy a map have you? It&#39;s really my husband you should be dealing with, but what a surprise! He&#39;s headed down below.&lt;page&gt;He&#39;ll pop back occasionally to deliver new maps for the store but I do wish he&#39;d spend a little more time up here. I&#39;ve not much interest in retail myself.&lt;page&gt;Now, let&#39;s see what&#39;s here for me to sell.
1. ISELDA_REPEAT
    > Are you enjoying yourself down in the ruins? At times my husband makes Hallownest sound a wonder, but sometimes it seems a ghastly, dangerous place.
1. ISELDA_GHOSTPIN
    > Corny was telling me of some distinctive graves and shrines about the kingdom. I&#39;ve made a new pin to represent them.&lt;page&gt;This one was quite challenging to make, and I laboured over the details. It&#39;s a nice result so I think it&#39;s worth a little more.
1. ISELDA_DREAM
    > I&#39;m glad I put down my weapon, this quiet life with Corny makes me a lot happier. It would be nice to stretch my legs again though... sometime soon...

1. SHADE_CHARM

1. SHADE_OFFER_INTRO
    > As a service, I can return your regrets to you, so they can be dealt with. You want that, yes?&lt;page&gt;Ah, but I am very hungry. Perhaps you&#39;d be willing to part with a little of your food? Sleep for as long as I have and you build up quite the appetite.
1. RITUAL_REPEAT
    > Farewell. I will think of you as I savour my meal.
1. MINES

1. NO_EGGS_REPEAT

1. NO_EGGS
    > Hmm, but you don&#39;t have any food on you. At least nothing that interests me. I can&#39;t perform on an empty stomach, so please return once you&#39;ve found something truly tasty... something nourishing.
1. NOSHADE
    > Ah, you don&#39;t appear to have any lingering regrets. How lucky for you. You don&#39;t need the services of one such as I.
1. ROYAL_GARDENS

1. DREAM
    > How long I must have slept. This land is so much darker now, so thick with the stains of regret.&lt;page&gt;Even the air is murkier. If I sleep again, will the darkness creep in here and swallow me whole?
1. DEEPNEST
    > Yes, I can see the regrets you&#39;ve left behind. A dark stain, barely visible in the tunnels of a nest deep below this kingdom.

There&#39;s plenty of wealth in these rocks for anyone willing to put a bit of work in!&lt;page&gt;Those crystals out there are worth a fair b-b-bit, but I have a feeling that there&#39;s something even more valuable hidden just a bit deeper in! I can almost smell it! Ha ha ha!
1. MINER_EARLY_2
    > Ohh, bury the knight with her broken nail,  
    bury the lady, lovely and pale!  
    Bury the priest in his tattered gown,  
    then bury the beggar with his shining croooown!
1. MINER_EARLY_3
    > This is hard work, but I don&#39;t mind. Down here, I can k-keep working without even sleeping. It&#39;s fun!&lt;page&gt;And every once in a while you c-c-come to visit me! I&#39;m glad... ha ha... I&#39;m glad you like the sound of my voice!

1. TUK_DUNG

1. LEGEATER_DUNG
    > Eeeauuggh! That smell you carry with you...&lt;page&gt;Ah! Ah! Ahhhhh!&lt;page&gt;...Very tasty!&lt;page&gt;You&#39;re sweet... to share such a tasty smell with me. Do you want a gift in return?&lt;page&gt;Cheaper... Yes. My beautiful gifts... I&#39;ll give them to you. Cheaper.

1. MINER_EARLY_1_B
    > You&#39;re welcome to join me, there&#39;s enough for both of us! Or if you don&#39;t feel like d-d-d-digging, you can just sit and sing with me! Ha ha ha!
1. QUEEN_MEET
    > Oh! One arrives. Far it walks to find me. Did it seek my aid? Or did the path carry it by chance to so pertinant a place?&lt;page&gt;It is true. True, that you were awaited. No. Perhaps that is inaccurate. True one like you was awaited.&lt;page&gt;I have a gift, held long for one of your kind. Half of a whole. When united, great power is granted, and on the path ahead, great power it will need.
1. DUNG_UNDERGROUND_1
    > Ahh, you&#39;re awake, and looking well-rested!&lt;page&gt;I was startled when I woke to find you curled up beside me, but of course you&#39;re welcome to rest here whenever the world wearies you.&lt;page&gt;As the King granted his kingdom, to shelter to those who needed it, I offer my home. Stay as long as you like, down here where it&#39;s cosy and warm and moist.
1. DUNG_UNDERGROUND_2
    > My cave may seem a far cry from the finery of the palace but even still the memories of my former comrades, and our glorious King, remain fresh in my mind.&lt;page&gt;The Pale Court was a wondrous place full of the age&#39;s greatest heroes. Ahh! Looking at you now, I can easily imagine you standing amongst them. 
1. CLOTH_GHOST_REPEAT

1. LEGEATER_PAID

1. BIGCAT_SHADECHARM

1. JINN_KING_BRAND

1. SPIDER_GREET2
    > My good friend. You wear that bright mark of relationship. Then you&#39;ve met her perhaps? Her who&#39;d guard the mark, the Gendered Child.&lt;page&gt;A spritely thing, isn&#39;t she? Pale gift to the Nest and the Beast, and fair trade for sacrifice made.&lt;page&gt;Long she&#39;s been distant. It&#39;d do our spirits well were she to grace us a visit home...&lt;page&gt;...He hee. Oh. Hmm. I am sorry. Old memories cause my mind to wander on such silly diversions, especially when I&#39;m oh so famished...
1. WHITE_DEFENDER_OUTRO_2

1. WHITE_DEFENDER_OUTRO_5

1. MASK_MAKER_UNMASK3
    > To change a face; to conceal it fully within another... A powerful protection that is, but one with sad consequence.&lt;page&gt;The original mind is destroyed, though those of striking will may still retain a sliver of that concealed self.
1. SPIDER_GREET
    > Ahh! It returns. I do apologise about before. Heehee. No matter. No matter. My appetite oft gets the better of me. For now at least, I&#39;m content.&lt;page&gt;Would you hear about myself? There&#39;s not so much to say. I&#39;m a servant to the nest, though few in recent times would seek my service.&lt;page&gt;Our brood is lost to that pestilence of the mind. A sad fall for the most intelligent species. &lt;page&gt;Ah, but hmmm. I&#39;ve eaten yes, and full. Then again, another little morsel would make me oh so happy. The perfect end to a meal...
1. CLOTH_DEEPNEST_DREAM
    > Such bad luck. The critters about here are just terrifying. Those scuttling legs, those gnashing teeth.&lt;page&gt;Tis not the end I&#39;d ever want to meet.

1. EMILITIA_KING_BRAND
    > Oh... hmm... Could it be? You&#39;ve returned at last? No. No... &lt;page&gt;Oh pardon me! For just a moment, I mistook a certain quality about you. You seemed almost... regal. &lt;page&gt;Silly, I know. It&#39;s clear you&#39;re not of high birth, wandering about all dirty and tattered like that. 
1. LITTLE_FOOL_NOTENOUGH
    > Ah, you lack the Geo to make a contribution. We can&#39;t make an exception, I&#39;m afraid. Return once you are worthier... and wealthier.
1. SPIDER_MEET
    > Oh. Please. Please. Don&#39;t be shy. There are some nasties about here alright. Not me. I&#39;m a friend to all and happy to serve a traveller so bold as you.&lt;page&gt;Is it information you seek? That I can provide. Yes. Oh yes. Heehee.&lt;page&gt;That village above here, home to a sad creature. Hers is a tale of tragic exchange. Cost her and her people greatly, though I suspect she bore no regret in making it. &lt;page&gt;Heehee, yes. I know. I know. You&#39;re intrigued. You want to know the tale. Well I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;d love to tell it, but I&#39;m just, I&#39;m very, very sorry, and I haven&#39;t eaten in some time...&lt;page&gt;And oh, I&#39;m STAA-AARVING...

1. TISO_SHIELD

1. QUEEN_MEET_REPEAT
    > Prepare well, but don&#39;t dally. Were the Vessel to break prematurely, that plague would unleash with rage and power built of ages chained.
1. GIRAFFE_LOWER
    > This place must once have been quite the hub, built at the border between two lands, that misty drop to one side and those bulbous growths another. &lt;page&gt;Neither place seems particularly welcoming so while my little treats last, I think I&#39;ll stay right here.
1. JINN_OFFER

1. LEGEATER_BROKEN
    > Eeeauuggh! You broke it! I gave you that charm as a gift, and you broke it! Clumsy little fool... Nasty.&lt;page&gt;Apologise, ask me nicely, and I&#39;ll fix it for you. Give me Geo and I&#39;ll fix it for you.

1. MOSS_CULTIST_02

1. GIRAFFE_MEET

1. XUN_HAVE_FLOWER2
    > Her grave lies in the middle of the Queen&#39;s old retreat. It&#39;s a far journey from here and you&#39;ve already learned how dangerous those paths can be.&lt;page&gt;Be safe...And be more careful. Me&#39;hon.
1. CLOTH_TOWN_GREET
    > Ah! Tiny warrior. I&#39;m glad I could see you again. You&#39;ve inspired me! I&#39;m about to head off in search of other places and other foes.&lt;page&gt;This quiet town&#39;s the perfect stop before I scale the cliffs and head out onto the plains.
1. LITTLE_FOOL_CHAMP

1. QUEEN_DREAM

1. LEGEATER_CONVO3

1. LEGEATER_CONVO4
    > Hmm. The air has changed, I can smell something new. Dangerous things are drifting through here now... are you scared?&lt;page&gt;If you stay here... I won&#39;t protect you.
1. WHITE_DEFENDER_OUTRO_3
    > My King... Hallownest will be reborn! Glorious and bright! Just as it always was...
1. DUNG_DEFENDER_1
    > Oh, it&#39;s you again. I&#39;m glad to see you return.&lt;page&gt;No, no, please... Don&#39;t say a word. I must apologise for my previous behaviour.&lt;page&gt;Entirely my fault. I mistook you for one of those mindless skulking husks, yet you bested me in the most majestic knightly fashion.
1. DUNG_DEFENDER_2
    > Such joyful, vigorous combat. I&#39;d almost forgotten the feeling.&lt;page&gt;I was once a Knight you see. By the grace of our good King, I stood proudly before the throne, watching Hallownest swell to greatness.&lt;page&gt;Then that nasty business with the affliction...
1. DUNG_DEFENDER_3
    > We knights defend against the physical, but a formless enemy. How to defeat such a foe?&lt;page&gt;Our King tried in his own way. A cruel means it was... And still, eventually, we were brought low.&lt;page&gt;Bah! I shouldn&#39;t be so morose. You&#39;ve invigorated me. Tis&#39; truly a delight to meet one whose strength can match my own.

1. BIGCAT_TALK_03
    > For quiet retreat did I climb up here, away from spitting creatures. Ormmph... Yes. High up. Away from simple minds, lost to light.&lt;page&gt;Theirs is a different kind of unity. Rejection of the Wyrm&#39;s attempt at order.&lt;page&gt;I resist the light&#39;s allure. Union it may offer, but also a mind bereft of thought... To instinct alone a bug is reduced...Hrrm...

I do tend to visualise new combatant&#39;s meeting their end. It&#39;s good training for the mind, especially whilst your movement&#39;s somewhat limited.
1. LEGEATER_NOSTOCK

    > Ahhhh.... Me&#39;hon. This world. This cruel, sinful world. Why does che&#39; wake? Why does che&#39; persist?&lt;page&gt;Ahhh Le&#39;mer, you could not know of tragedy as complete as che&#39;s, true lovers stripped apart, two worlds that could not meet.&lt;page&gt;And now meled&#39;lover, dead so long in time. Dead, so far away. Buried, moina? Ai. Amongst its hateful kin that did deny our union, that did reject che&#39;s... outside-ness.&lt;page&gt;She doesn&#39;t suppose?... Nahlo, Nahlo. Could che&#39; ask? Could che&#39; burden?&lt;page&gt;Le&#39;mer, woulds&#39;t you, coulds&#39;t you deliver gift to her grave?&lt;page&gt;The gift is, maybe small? But the trek is long. She rests amongst her kind near our Queen&#39;s lush refuge.&lt;page&gt;Would such a thing be done? Che&#39; asks perhaps impossible things? Mad things? For Le&#39;mer to take up such quest would be a kindness che&#39; has near forgotten.

It is, after all, from a journey we find our purpose, though a stop is more than just a stop.&lt;page&gt;And my if those stops can&#39;t be lovely things, wouldn&#39;t you say? Transcendant plateaus, distant sandy lands, vast ancient kingdoms. Yours was not the first, nor will it be the last, but it&#39;s a unique and special thing nonetheless.&lt;page&gt;Now, with my duties here finished, it&#39;s time I made graceful departure.

Che&#39; thought she could bear no more.&lt;page&gt;...I suppose, che&#39; does have one more flower though.&lt;page&gt;But Le&#39;mer! This one is equally sacred and equally fragile. Where&#39;st one to accept such quest, it must become mel&#39;precious heart. Would such a thing be again be tried?
1. CLOTH_GHOST
    > Well now that was something! A true battle of mighty warriors. So intense. So climactic. It&#39;s really everything I could have ever hoped for.&lt;page&gt;Thanks for all your help, my friend. For a tiny bug you set a valiant example. We&#39;ll meet again, I&#39;m sure of it. 
1. BRETTA_DIARY_2
    > The White Saviour Returns  
    Long had they remained apart and the village, once so warm, now grew cold. The maiden felt the well of grief. It gripped fierce about her lonely shell.&lt;page&gt;And suddenly, as though her tragic state was sensed, the saviour returned, standing tall, glowing bright. Below shining horns, eyes welled black, glistening, eyes only for the maiden long missed, long desired.&lt;page&gt;Her saviour leaned close, sat beside, perfectly composed. In that charged, breathless moment not a word needed be spoken, &lt;page&gt;The maiden&#39;s shell felt suddenly tight. Her claws curled. No glance was shared, no claws touched, just perfect, aching love shared in silence, together...
1. XUN_SUCCESS1
    > Mi&#39;? Le&#39;mer, you have done this thing? Is it possible? This world&#39;s cruelty, I&#39;d thought it overwhelming, but le&#39;mer, such great compassion. That Che&#39;s love would know her partner&#39;s heart even aeon past.
1. XUN_SUCCESS2

1. EMILITIA_MEET
    > Ah, what a surprise! It&#39;s not often I receive visitors. It&#39;s been so long. Ages even. I just hope my manners haven&#39;t left me.&lt;page&gt;You&#39;ve no doubt sensed my affluence. You&#39;re right to guess, I&#39;m renowned amongst the upper caste of Hallownest.&lt;page&gt;...Well I was... once, until those cretins cast me out.&lt;page&gt;Have you met them, my former fellows? That&#39;s them outside, their bodies shambling around all mindless and empty. And I&#39;m still alive to witness their pathetic demise.&lt;page&gt;Ahhh, I&#39;m just so happy.

    > Am I in over my head? Even these shroom creatures almost did me in and far nastier things await further down.&lt;page&gt;Curse me and my foolish bravado! If I could shed my pride, I&#39;d be asking this tiny warrior for help. 
1. BIGCAT_DREAM
    > One prefers its mind not be pried. Is rather unsettling. Rather invasive.
1. MASK_MAKER_REPEAT
    > A wonderful thing to have, a face. Not a thing with which we all are blessed. 
1. JINN_NOEGG
    > ...A problem. It did not bring the gift Jinn wants. No trade can occur... None.&lt;page&gt;...Will It seek out the gift Jinn wants? The horrible... round... disgusting gift? Will It return? Jinn will be waiting...
1. MR_MUSHROOM_SHROOMISH1
    > Nyush oola mumu? Shruba dungo ola, ola mu... gungi.
1. BIGCAT_INTRO
    > Ohrm... Tiny thing. You climb high. Seek then knowledge of these lands?&lt;page&gt;This ashen place is grave of Wyrm. Once told, it came to die. But what is death for that ancient being? More transformation methinks.&lt;page&gt;This failed kingdom is product of the being spawned from that event.
1. QUEEN_REPEAT_SHADECHARM
    > That pulsing emptiness... Truly, it has been transformed by the revelations it found.&lt;page&gt;Does it... feel anything? Triumph? Or hate? If it does, I cannot sense it.&lt;page&gt;The fate of our Kingdom, our Hallownest... that future belongs to you now.
1. QUEEN_HORNET
    > It faced the Gendered Child? She&#39;s a fierce foe, strong in mind and body, striking reflection of her mother, though the two were permitted little time together.&lt;page&gt;I never begrudged the Wyrm&#39;s dalliance as bargain. In fact, I feel some affection for the creature birthed.&lt;page&gt;If your paths were ever to align, I imagine you might gain yourself a powerful ally.
1. CLOTH_TRAMWAY_DREAM_HAPPY
    > Such luck! This tiny one appears at just the right moment. And what masterful skill it shows!&lt;page&gt;As a warrior it sets powerful precedent. I&#39;d do well to learn from its form.
1. LITTLE_FOOL_MEET
    > Aha! Another warrior finds their way to our fair Colosseum. Ours is the final destination for all seeking trials of intense and deadly combat.&lt;page&gt;All one has to do is place their mark upon their Trial Board of choice and lo! The arena&#39;s gate will open.&lt;page&gt;There&#39;s a small fee attached to each trial, but I&#39;m sure as skilled a combatant as yourself will have accrued a wealth of Geo.&lt;page&gt;Now, before you draw your nail and rush eagerly to battle, I&#39;ll offer one quick word of advice.&lt;page&gt;There&#39;s a warriors&#39; pit just below here, where others like yourself await their own trials. I&#39;d strongly advise using it to rest up before placing your mark.&lt;page&gt;Oh and have no doubt, I&#39;m a fearsome warrior myself. Don&#39;t go judging me by my size, or my current... errr... constraint. The Colosseum beckons us both! I&#39;ll be back in battle soon.
1. LITTLE_FOOL_PAID
    > Very well then, a new trial is open to you. I hope your performance is spectacular...
1. MINER_MEET_1
    > Ohhh, bury my mother, pale and slight,  
    bury my father with his eyes shut tight!  
    Bury my sisters two by two,  
    and then when you&#39;re done, let&#39;s bury me toooo!
1. TISO_COLOSSEUM
    > Pale one. You found it too then, this perfect place. I&#39;ll soon be entering the battle. Just taking a moment to rest first.&lt;page&gt;Though few could truly challenge me, I&#39;m hoping this arena presents the sort of brutal challenge I&#39;m after.
1. CLOTH_TRAMWAY_GREET
    > My friend, you dealt with all of those beasts?&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m ashamed to say... I was hiding. Those ghastly things chased me and I ran. If you hadn&#39;t come along, who knows if I&#39;d ever have survived.&lt;page&gt;Others take me for a fearsome warrior, what with my impressive size, but this kingdom&#39;s beasts, I wonder if I&#39;m just no match for them?...
1. QUEEN_DUNG
    > ...That scent. Does another travel with you? Is that you Ogrim, my mighty Knight?&lt;page&gt;I cannot see you, but then time has clouded my eyes and I cannot see much. Even your booming voice falls silent upon me.&lt;page&gt;Only this small one I register, if maybe because it shares some piece of myself. This one stands clear upon a misted world.&lt;page&gt;Ah.... But my my, that potent smell does recall such joyous memory. Only a short moment we had together, compared to ruin now endured, but what shining times they were.&lt;page&gt;I am grateful you would visit, even if to see me in somewhat faded form.
1. CLOTH_FUNG_MEET
    > Ah ha! The tiny steps of a tiny creature. You got the look of an adventurer, so we&#39;ve much in common.&lt;page&gt;Searching for dangerous places aye? Well you&#39;re on the right track.&lt;page&gt;A long necked critter warned me of a tribe deeper down. Warrior sorts, so she says and I&#39;m itching for some serious combat.
1. TISO_TOWN_GREET
    > Pale thing. You wear that nail with ease. If you&#39;re in search of combat, you&#39;ll find no great warriors in this decaying burrow. &lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve heard an arena exists somewhere below. One built for our like. Meet me there and we&#39;ll test what skills you possess.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ll be heading down soon. Come and find me if you dare.
1. XUN_HAVE_FLOWER
    > Her grave lies in the middle of the Queen&#39;s old retreat, a far journey from here and the roads between are fraught with beasts.&lt;page&gt;Safe tiding on your journey. My heart does flutter to feel such kindness from so tiny a creature.
1. MOSS_CULTIST_DREAM

1. JINN_MEET
    > ...Is It... here, waking Jinn?..&lt;page&gt;Observed... Small. Dull. No Soul. Long shadow... It is blank, but brave...&lt;page&gt;Does it bring offering?&lt;page&gt;Jinn, has only many small, shiny things... useless to Jinn, but will trade for wonderful gift.
1. LITTLE_FOOL_MARK
    > To enter a trial, step over to the board and place your mark. From that point on, your destiny is your own...
1. TISO_BENCH_GREET
    > Ehh. Pale thing. You use these old lines? Pathetic. A real warrior carries himself to combat. He has no need for such convenience.
1. LITTLE_FOOL_OFFER_1
    > Make a contribution, and you can enter the Trial of the Warrior.
1. LITTLE_FOOL_OFFER_2

1. JINN_SHADE_CHARM
    > This It... A rare It. Has not seen many, so vulnerable, but triumphant. Makes Jinn feel a thing... surprise?&lt;page&gt;Jinn misjudged... The It is not inferior. Perhaps... different? Different to Jinn. More complete? Different... like masters?
1. JONN_NOEGG_REPEAT

    bury the... p-priest... something about a crown...?  
    I c-can&#39;t remember the rest of that one, ha ha ha! Maybe I&#39;ll just hum it.
1. CLOTH_TRAMWAY_MEET
    > Oh! Ahh. Such a tiny creature, yet you dealt with all of those beasts?&lt;page&gt;I wasn&#39;t hiding, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re thinking. Just waiting for the right moment to pounce!...No... I can&#39;t speak such a lie... I was hiding.&lt;page&gt;Those ghastly things chased me and I ran. If you hadn&#39;t come along, who knows if I&#39;d ever have survived.&lt;page&gt;Others take me for a fearsome warrior, what with my impressive size, but this kingdom&#39;s beasts, I wonder if I&#39;m just no match for them?...&lt;page&gt;...

1. BRETTA_DIARY_1
    > The White Saviour  
    The maiden woke in darkness. Confused she reached out. Sharp brambles jabbed at all sides. Burning acid bubbled close below. What nightmare had led her here? What hope of survival remained?&lt;page&gt;Doomed she thought herself and to despair she fell, until a light bloomed far in the distance, a bright, glowing spot fast approaching. It swept majestic about the thorns, leapt above burning waters and dove towards the maiden.&lt;page&gt;Coming close, the form revealed at last, a beautiful being, sharp horns gleaming white. Arms reached out for the damsel, gathering her up, grip firm...
1. KING_ABYSS_05
    > Born of God and Void.
1. BRETTA_DIARY_3
    > The White Saviour in Darkness  
    Troubled dreams beset the maiden. Her saviour gone, consumed below. Now her only companion the cold wind, moaning at her door. Her heart fluttered with sudden fear...&lt;page&gt;Then still. A sudden calm. Why? A presence. A figure close behind.&lt;page&gt;She doesn&#39;t dare look, doesn&#39;t dare move, fearful the slightest action would break the spell. She knew the presence at her bed, knew the calm only they could bring.&lt;page&gt;Her white saviour, now protector, standing tall beside, powerful, perfect...
1. BRETTA_DIARY_4
    > The Grey Prince  
    Heaving heavy breaths; flush from the exertion of battle; the figure emerged from the well. Triumph was his and trophy he bore to prove it, the fearsome skull of his vanquished opponent.&lt;page&gt;Startling warning he brought to the village, one that rung so true: Their white saviour, thought a hero by the bugs, was a vicious beast and this shrouded grey prince was in truth the hero deserved.&lt;page&gt;With honour and humility he recounted his quest below, his epic journey of one purpose, to find her, to protect her, his grey maiden, his partner in darkness...
1. TUK_REPEAT
    > I&#39;ll share my food with you... if you give me Geo.
1. CLOTH_DEEPNEST_REPEAT

1. MASK_MAKER_DREAM
    > ...Does it know of the face that hides beneath? Such remarkable contrast the Wyrm conceived....
1. QUEEN_REPEAT_KINGSOUL
    > Ahh! So it bears our once-fractured soul, now complete. Such strength, such resolve, such dedication! Is it more than simply a Vessel? I almost feel like I&#39;m once again in the presence of my beloved Wyrm.&lt;page&gt;The Kingsoul... What is at the heart of it I wonder? If its curiosity wills it, it should seek out that place. That place where it was born, where it died, where it began...
1. JINN_REOFFER
    > ...Another? Does It offer gift to Jinn...?
1. JINN_ACCEPT
    > ...Gift is... horrible gift. Digusting...&lt;page&gt;But Jinn knows one who appreciates...Friend of Jinn. Eats nasties. Loves nasties. Shall accept. Shall provide.&lt;page&gt;Shinies for tiny It... Good to give Shinies. Less burden for Jinn.
1. BRETTA_DREAM_BENCH
    > My saviour, so close... 
1. KING_ABYSS_FINAL_A
    > You shall seal the blinding light that plagues their dreams.
1. KING_ABYSS_FINAL_B
    > You are the Vessel.
1. KING_ABYSS_FINAL_C
    > You are the Hollow Knight.
1. QUEEN_TALK_01
    > Within my roots, the weakening of the Vessel I plainly feel. Only two obvious outcomes there are from such a thing.&lt;page&gt;The first is inevitable on current course, regression, all minds relinquished to that pernicious plague.&lt;page&gt;The second I find preferable, and would seek your aid in its occurance, replacement.&lt;page&gt;I implore you, usurp the Vessel. Its supposed strength was ill-judged. It was tarnished by an idea instilled. But you. You are free of such blemishes. You could contain that thing inside.
1. XUN_ACCEPT
    > Rare boon you grant Le&#39;mer. It will be che&#39;s last request. After this, never shall che&#39; lay burden on another.&lt;page&gt;A sacred flower is the offering. It is a rare, delicate object. One of a kind. You must cherish it, must act as though it were your own heart.&lt;page&gt;If you were to get hurt whilst carrying it, or did to attempt ride those jolting transit beasts, it would forever be destroyed.&lt;page&gt;Her grave lies in the middle of the Queen&#39;s overgrown estate. It is surrounded by her kind, who will not look kindly on your trespass.&lt;page&gt;Take care Le&#39;mer. My hopes I place upon you and my fervent wish that this small solace may come to pass.
1. MR_MUSHROOM_DREAM_SHROOMISH

1. LITTLE_FOOL_COWARD
    > You placed your mark and left! What cowardice! Maybe you don&#39;t have what it takes?&lt;page&gt;A true warrior strides unstopping into battle. They gain strength by vanquishing others, not in flight from them.
1. BIGCAT_REPEAT
    > Hmpph...Be on your way then? It&#39;s rest I&#39;ll return to, though in these times sleep oft proves uneasy. 
1. LITTLE_FOOL_OPEN
    > Will you place your mark and attempt a trial?
1. MR_MUSHROOM_1
    > ...It&#39;s nice that you were able to help your friend. So you&#39;re not hungry any more?&lt;page&gt;Yes, that was quite the appetite. I was impressed. Still, we all move on sooner or later.&lt;page&gt;To greater things, perhaps? So much can be achieved in just a short time...
1. MR_MUSHROOM_2
    > ...Shouldn&#39;t trust the eye they gave you. Rely on your own instincts.&lt;page&gt;If you&#39;ve got a keen nose, use it.&lt;page&gt;And while you&#39;re hunting for secrets, beware those who are hunting you!
1. MR_MUSHROOM_3
    > ...The dead can&#39;t make use of wealth in any case. What would they spend it on?&lt;page&gt;Yes, a big brood like that. They need food. And shelter. And toys.&lt;page&gt;If you keep some for yourself... Well, I think you deserve it. Yes...
1. MR_MUSHROOM_4
    > ...What was called a &quot;hero&quot; in its moment may be called something very different after time has passed. &lt;page&gt;The crimes and triumphs of our predecessors echo all around us, don&#39;t they?&lt;page&gt;The chains of fate that bind us all together... do you really want to break them?
1. MR_MUSHROOM_5
    > ...Well if things are getting too dangerous down there, maybe it&#39;s time to take a break?&lt;page&gt;Come back up and spend some time hunting, or gathering, or wandering aimlessly.&lt;page&gt;No, not too much longer now...
1. MR_MUSHROOM_6
    > ...I haven&#39;t seen her, no. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll remember where you left her eventually.&lt;page&gt;Trust the moon, or yourself. Or trust her. You need to trust something, that&#39;s my point.&lt;page&gt;Hmm? No, not him. No. Absolutely not.
1. MR_MUSHROOM_7
    > ...It&#39;s not by tools that you&#39;ll triumph, it&#39;s through your smarts, your speed, your determination....
1. MINER_EARLY_2_B

1. DUNG_DEFENDER_ISMA
    > Ahh! That tear... You&#39;ve been to her grove!&lt;page&gt;I swore I&#39;d visit, but... my duties... my oath...&lt;page&gt;Oh, I&#39;m sorry. Ignore me, I&#39;m being foolish. If I&#39;m not careful I&#39;ll sink down into old memories and won&#39;t ever come back again.&lt;page&gt;She&#39;s a great judge of character, so if she gave you her blessing you must be something special indeed. I&#39;m barely worthy to be in your presence!
1. LEGEATER_GREET

1. CLOTH_QG_REPEAT

1. EMILITIA_GREET

1. CLOTH_FUNG_GREET

1. MINER_MEET_1_B

Ha ha ha!&lt;page&gt;So, what are you down here for? If you came to g-get wealthy, just look around you! These mines are still bursting with riches! There&#39;s p-p-plenty for everyone, just grab a pick and join in! Ha ha!
1. QUEEN_TALK_02
    > I&#39;ll offer fair warning. The Vessel may itself be weak, but it is much empowered by that force within.&lt;page&gt;To claim its role requires strength of some magnitude. Prepare yourself well before attempting the task.
1. LEGEATER_REMEET

### Nail Masters

1. MATO_GREET  
    > My pupil, you have come to visit your old master! This is an honour I scarcely deserve.&lt;page&gt;Please, sit. You are always welcome to meditate here with me.
1. MATO_ORO  
    > That Nail Art, the Dash Slash... learnt from my brother Oro, was it not?&lt;page&gt;So he is still alive then. Hm. I still haven&#39;t forgotten what he owes me and I never will.&lt;page&gt;Oh, I&#39;m sorry. I shouldn&#39;t bother you with such things. I&#39;m happy that you were able to train under another Nailmaster and grow stronger, my pupil.
1. ORO_GREET  
    > You&#39;ve returned, though you were not invited. &lt;page&gt;As my pupil, it is lawful that I allow you rest and shelter, but do not stay longer than you need to.
1. ORO_MATO  
    > That Nail Art... you have been training with my brother Mato.&lt;page&gt;He has strange notions of loyalty and honour. I&#39;m sure he was difficult and unpleasant to train under.&lt;page&gt;Did he mention my name to you? If he does, tell him to be patient. He&#39;ll be waiting a while longer before I give him what he wants.
1. ORO_BOW  
    > I have taught you all I can. Go back into the world, traveller. Leave me to my solitude.
1. ORO_ART  
    > So what will it be, traveller? Will you pay the price asked of you, or will you leave this place unenlightened?
1. ORO_SLY  
    > That charm you bear... It seems the Great Nailsage has deemed you skilled enough in the Nail Arts to earn his highest esteem.&lt;page&gt;I do not begrudge you his love. You have earned it.&lt;page&gt;And perhaps by helping you along your path, I have redeemed myself... if only a little.
1. MATO_SHEO  
    > Ah! So my brother Sheo has taught you his Nail Art, the Great Slash! How lucky you are to have trained with him!&lt;page&gt;Sheo and I were very close when we trained together under the Great Nailsage. He often spoke of becoming tired of the Nail Arts and wanting to try something new.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m glad to see he changed his mind and continues to bear the proud title of Nailmaster along with me!
1. MATO_REPEAT  
    > Before you leave, rest and meditate with me for a while. Your company is always welcome.
1. MATO_TAUGHT  
    > Your form... exquisite! Now I know how my own master felt when he passed down his teachings to us.&lt;page&gt;I hope you don&#39;t think me too forward when I say that I consider you to be my child. Yes! When I saw you perform my Nail Art I felt a bond between us suddenly flash into existence!&lt;page&gt;You honour me beyond words, my pupil...&lt;page&gt;Thank you.
1. MATO_REFUSE  
    > My pupil, why do you hesitate? Do you think yourself unworthy of my Nail Art?&lt;page&gt;Do not fret. I too was once like you, unsure of my own strength. Stay here with me and meditate, and once you are ready we can begin the lesson.
1. SHEO_MATO  
    > That Nail Art you&#39;ve learnt, the Cyclone Slash. That was always Mato&#39;s favourite.&lt;page&gt;It must have made him ecstatic to have a pupil like you. He always wanted to pass down what he&#39;d learnt to a new generation.&lt;page&gt;He was not the most skilled pupil himself, but his enthusiasm and his kindness set him apart. I&#39;m glad he achieved what he desired for so long. To be a teacher...
1. SHEO_MEET  
    > A visitor! Why have you crept in here, little grub? Perhaps, like me, you have a taste for discovering new things?&lt;page&gt;I am Sheo, and in a previous life I was a Nailmaster. Yes, the only thing that drove me was becoming stronger and honing my skills with a nail.&lt;page&gt;I imagined it was my one calling in life, but that feeling faded over time. Now I seek a new calling, something that speaks to my soul and compels me forward.&lt;page&gt;That&#39;s why I spend my time here, secluded, trying to master the art of creation. Painting, sculpting... these things bring a different kind of pleasure.&lt;page&gt;Mmm. You don&#39;t seem very moved by what I&#39;ve said. Was it Sheo the Nailmaster you were looking for? Did you come to learn a Nail Art? I&#39;ll teach you if you insist...
1. ORO_MEET  
    > Hmph. How did you find me, down here where the world ends?&lt;page&gt;Yes, I know why you&#39;re here. You came to learn a Nail Art from the legendary Nailmaster Oro.&lt;page&gt;It is the law of the Great Nailsage that I must pass down my teachings to those who are worthy.&lt;page&gt;But no law forbids me from exacting a payment for my time. If you truly wish to train under me, prove it with Geo!
1. SHEO_ART  
    > Something about your bearing... I feel as though you haven&#39;t yet abandoned the way of the nail. I can teach you something, if you like... 
1. SHEO_SLY  
    > That charm! Only the Great Nailsage could have given that to you...&lt;page&gt;Seeing how strong you&#39;ve become... it almost makes me want to take up my nail once more.&lt;page&gt;But no, I should stay on my current path and keep working at my art. If the Great Nailsage ever comes by, I want to show him how far I&#39;ve come.
1. MATO_BOW  
    > You honour me beyond words, my pupil...&lt;page&gt;Thank you.
1. MATO_ART  
    > Ah, I can see it in your eyes - you&#39;re ready to learn my Nail Art! Shall we begin the lesson immediately?
1. ORO_REFUSE  
    > &quot;Those who do not share their strength will never learn.&quot; My master used to say that.&lt;page&gt;Substitute &quot;Geo&quot; for &quot;strength&quot; and you&#39;ll have my own views on the matter. Begone!
1. MATO_SLY  
    > That charm...! Could it be?! Only the Great Nailsage himself could have bestowed such a thing!&lt;page&gt;Your achievements humble my own, my pupil. I myself have sworn never to lay eyes on the Nailsage again. Not until I have truly mastered his teachings.&lt;page&gt;But if you see him again, please... let him know that I am forever grateful.
1. ORO_REPEAT

    > Hmph. I must say, you are an excellent pupil.&lt;page&gt;Your skill with the nail, and your thirst to become stronger... you remind me of my brothers.&lt;page&gt;I have taught you all I can. Go back into the world, traveller, and leave me to my solitude.
1. ORO_SHEO  
    > I see you&#39;ve been taught a Nail Art by my brother Sheo. How fortunate of you.&lt;page&gt;Yes, he was the mightiest of the Great Nailsage&#39;s pupils, far outshining Mato and myself. My brother and my master loved him very much.&lt;page&gt;He was always aloof, but... not unkind. When we last spoke, he said he was going to teach himself something completely new. I wonder if he achieved that goal.
1. SHEO_REFUSE  
    > Oh? Have you, too, grown weary of the weight of a nail? I understand. Stay, if you like, and we can make art together.
1. SHEO_NAILSMITH  
    > Oh, look who&#39;s joined us! We have quite a merry crowd now, don&#39;t we?&lt;page&gt;This fellow came wandering in to my hut, quite distraught and on his own quest for a new calling in life.&lt;page&gt;We talked, and found a common love of creating and building and honing a craft. So now we make art together!&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s good to have company, I hadn&#39;t realised how lonely I was. It&#39;s like being with my brothers again! Stay with us, if you like!
1. SHEO_REPEAT  
    > I have spare brushes and plenty of paint. Once you tire of the nail, feel free to join me in my art.
1. SHEO_DREAM  
    > My brother, Oro... what drove you to hide away deep down at the very edge of that ash swept grave?&lt;page&gt;Was it pride, or fear, or shame? Perhaps you should lay down your nail if it haunts you so, and find a new calling that eases your soul.
1. MATO_DREAM  
    > My brother, Sheo... how fare you in that green kingdom of thorns you call home? I think of you every time I raise my nail...&lt;page&gt;Do you ever close your eyes and remember the time we spent together with Oro and our master? I like to think you do...
1. SHEO_TAUGHT  
    > So! My work, does it move you?&lt;page&gt;The wielding of a nail, the wielding of a brush... these things are not so different.&lt;page&gt;We cut into the world so that we can peer deeper inside.&lt;page&gt;For now though, I have nothing more to teach you. Your path forwards... only you can see it. Good luck.
1. SHEO_ORO  
    > So you met my brother Oro and convinced him to teach you his Nail Art. Hmm.&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve seen him. I wonder how much he&#39;s changed. He always seemed to be haunted by something, though I never learned what.&lt;page&gt;No matter the distance between us though, we are still brothers. I hope that passing down his learnings to you brought him some happiness.
1. SHEO_REPEAT_MODEL  
    > Building these models takes patience and a light touch. It&#39;s worth it though, seeing the grand old Knights of Hallownest come to life before our eyes.&lt;page&gt;Mighty Hegemol was always my favourite. What a towering figure he was, though surprisingly soft spoken for one so large.&lt;page&gt;They were all impressive in their own right, of course. Fierce Dryya, kindly Isma, mysterious Ze&#39;mer... erm, and the other one.
1. ORO_DREAM  
    > Brother Mato, in your lonely home at the top of the world... do you still think of me as an enemy?&lt;page&gt;In the future, if you will listen... I will tell you why I chose to tread this path.
1. MATO_MEET  
    > Hm? Ah, well met! Yes, I thought I could sense the aura of a fierce warrior approaching.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m impressed you found my sanctuary here at the top of the world. No doubt you&#39;ve endured many trials and overcome many foes in your quest to find me.&lt;page&gt;No, don&#39;t speak a word. I, Nailmaster Mato, who was taught the Art of the Nail by the Great Nailsage himself, hereby accept you as my pupil! Let us begin the lesson immediately!
1. SHEO_GREET  
    > So, your travels have brought you back. What have you learnt? How have you grown?&lt;page&gt;Myself? I am still trying to capture something with my brush... although I&#39;m not quite sure what that thing is.

1. NAILSMITH_NOT_ENOUGH_GEO
    > Ah, you don&#39;t have the Geo? Come and see me when you do.
1. MODELLING
    > We&#39;re building a full suite of the Kingdom&#39;s Knights. In their time, I barely ever paid them attention, but Sheo keenly remembers each.&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s so refreshing. Nothing like the crude practice of Nailwork. I just love all the intricate details.
1. PAINTED
    > I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t speak at length. If I move too much, Sheo&#39;s masterwork will be ruined and I&#39;d hate to see him upset.&lt;page&gt;Though he may seem imposing, in truth he&#39;s a delicate sort.
1. NAILSMITH_DREAM_CLIFF
    > My life&#39;s work achieved... What more is left...?
1. NAILSMITH_ACCEPT
    > As you wish. I&#39;ll get to work then.
1. NAILSMITH_GREET
    > Hmm? Oh, you&#39;ve returned.
1. ART_MEET
    > Hmm? Oh, hello traveller. How strange that we should meet again in a world as vast as this.&lt;page&gt;I must thank you for not killing me when I asked you to. I was irritated at first, but I had some time to think up there and I soon saw the wisdom in your decision.&lt;page&gt;The world is made of more than metal and weapons. I set out exploring, and soon found my way here.&lt;page&gt;Sheo is a master of many arts, and has promised to teach me what he can. I think I&#39;ll be quite happy here.
1. ART_DREAM
    > ....An age spent toiling alone... this is much nicer...
1. NAILSMITH_MEET_1
    > Have you brought me another nail to be honed? Leave it on the ground and return later, if you&#39;re still breathing.
1. NAILSMITH_MEET_2
    > Hmm?&lt;page&gt;Oh. I thought you were someone else.
1. NAILSMITH_MEET_3
    > After a Nailsmith are you? Well you&#39;ve found one. I&#39;m not much for talk, but if its a nail that needs repair then you&#39;ve come to the right bug.&lt;page&gt;Your own nail is in quite a sorry state. It&#39;s obviously not one of mine. Still, anything can be refined with enough effort and skill, even that broken blade.
1. NAILSMITH_KILL_REPEAT
    > Do not hesitate. I beg you. Cut me down! I want to taste that blade&#39;s exquisite edge.
1. NAILSMITH_OFFER_ORE
    > I see you have some Pale Ore. A rare, fine metal, that. Give me the ore and some Geo for my efforts, and I&#39;ll reforge your nail to make it stronger.
1. NAILSMITH_REGREET
    > Hmm? You&#39;re still here. Is there something else you want?
1. NAILSMITH_OFFER
    > If you&#39;d like, I can reforge your nail. It&#39;ll make the blade far more deadly.
1. NAILSMITH_KILL
    > With a Pure Nail forged, my work in this lifetime comes to an end. My only remaining desire is to see and feel the nail strike true!&lt;page&gt;I beg you, cut me down. As my final moment in life, I want to taste the blade&#39;s exquisite edge.&lt;page&gt;After all this time, all this toil... haven&#39;t I earned it?
1. NAILSMITH_SIGN
    > Unused
1. MODELLING_REPEAT
    > This is fabulous. I&#39;d never have believed my claws capable of such deft construction.
1. NAILSMITH_DECLINE
    > You&#39;re not interested, then? Suit yourself.
1. NAILSMITH_COMPLETE_1
    > There we go. The reforging is complete.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve honed your nail&#39;s edge. You&#39;ll find it much stronger than it used to be.&lt;page&gt;Head out there and test its strength against your foes.
1. NAILSMITH_COMPLETE_2
    > There we go. The reforging is complete.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve added a channel to your nail. It should cut much more efficiently. You&#39;ll find it stronger than it used to be.&lt;page&gt;Head out there and test its blade against your foes.
1. NAILSMITH_COMPLETE_3
    > Here we are. The reforging is complete.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve modified the nail to spiral form. A very tricky task it was. You&#39;ll find it stronger than ever before.&lt;page&gt;Off you go now. Cut your way forward.
1. NAILSMITH_COMPLETE_4
    > It&#39;s done. The reforging is done.&lt;page&gt;Your nail is much stronger than it used to be. As strong as it could ever be.&lt;page&gt;In only your weapon have I seen such potential. Finally, I behold the majesty of a Pure Nail. &lt;page&gt;To think this moment has come upon me so soon...&lt;page&gt;...I... I must step outside a moment...
1. NAILSMITH_DREAM_INTERIOR
    > ...To forge the perfect Nail...
1. PAINTED_REPEAT
    > In all the dark of Hallownest, who&#39;d have thought I&#39;d meet such an inspiring soul.
1. NAILSMITH_NEED_ORE1
    > If you bring me a piece of Pale Ore, I can forge it into your nail and make it stronger still.
1. NAILSMITH_NEED_ORE2
    > If you bring me two pieces of Pale Ore, I can forge it into your nail and make it stronger still.
1. NAILSMITH_NEED_ORE3
    > If you bring me three pieces of Pale Ore, I can forge it into your nail and make it stronger still.

    > Did she call you too then? I realise it&#39;s no coincidence we arrive together. &lt;page&gt;Though much of my memory is blank, this place I recall.&lt;page&gt;Within these chambers the Teacher sought to store the Kingdom&#39;s knowledge and at its core, she stored herself.
1. QUIRREL_TEACHER_1B
    > To save Hallownest, the Teacher willingly became a seal, but upon herself she enacted an additional protection.&lt;page&gt;Though I cannot recall its happening, I played a part in that feat.
1. QUIRREL_TEACHER_1C
    > She called me here, now, to reverse that protection. All in aid of you.
1. DREAM_EGGTEMPLE
    > What is this feeling?... So familiar. Drawn forward yet repelled.&lt;page&gt;And those shapes upon the door...To gaze directly at them turns my mind to fog.
1. QUIRREL_NODREAMNAIL
    > Ahh, but her mind is still locked to you. That final, powerful protection stays in place.&lt;page&gt;If you would attempt to break her seal, you&#39;ve first to discover the means to open a mind. Such tools may exist to perform the feat, though in my own travels I&#39;ve not come across one.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;d heard it told the Kingdom&#39;s moths did delve amongst dreams and the dead. Perhaps you&#39;d seek them out?
1. DREAM_MANTIS_VILLAGE
    > ...Who was it that told me of the Nailsmith? I can&#39;t even remember, yet I can almost picture the smith himself... 
1. QUIRREL_MEET_TEMPLE
    > Hello there! How delightful to meet another traveller on these forgotten roads.&lt;page&gt;You&#39;re a short one, but you&#39;ve a strong look about you.
1. DREAM_CITY
    > Hallownest&#39;s heart...Magnificent even in mourning.
1. QUIRREL_QUEENSTATION_01
    > Isn&#39;t this something. I&#39;d not expected to discover so huge a Stag Station after that foggy descent.&lt;page&gt;The bugs of Hallownest must&#39;ve been an impressive lot, building such grand structures so far into these wilds.&lt;page&gt;Seems the dangerous creatures about haven&#39;t yet made their way in here. It&#39;s the perfect place for a quick rest.
1. QUIRREL_QUEENSTATION_02
    > Can you imagine this place in its time? Hordes of bugs travelling about the Kingdom; stag bells ringing; the station bustling with activity and life.&lt;page&gt;Now only our like even know it exists.&lt;page&gt;That&#39;s a special thing I suppose, to cherish these sights, even in their decay.
1. QUIRREL_GREENPATH_1
    > Oh, hello there! Seems we both tread far from the path.&lt;page&gt;I can hardly believe those dusty old highways led to such a lush and lively place!&lt;page&gt;This building suggests some form of worship, though its idol has clearly been long forgotten. Doubles equally well for a moment&#39;s respite.
1. QUIRREL_GREENPATH_2
    > I saw a strange fellow out there. He seemed quite taken by the lake.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;d planned to offer greetings, though figured I&#39;d first tend to my nail on chance our meeting goes poorly. 
1. QUIRREL_GREENPATH_3
    > Your nail looks a fine instrument, but it&#39;s showing signs of wear.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;d wager up there it would take you far. Down here however, I suspect you&#39;ll soon meet dangers the surface world can&#39;t match.
1. DREAM_ARCHIVE_ENTRANCE
    > ...Who are you, that leads me to this place? 
1. DREAM_ARCHIVE_INTERIOR
    > To think, such a small creature would bear this kingdom&#39;s fate.
1. QUIRREL_MEET_TEMPLE_B
    > I&#39;m Quirrel. I have something of an obsession with uncharted places.&lt;page&gt;This ancient kingdom holds many fascinating mysteries, and one of the most intriguing of them is standing right before us.
1. QUIRREL_MEET_TEMPLE_C
    > A great stone egg, lying in the corpse of an ancient kingdom. And this egg...Is it warm? It certainly gives off a unique air.&lt;page&gt;Can it be opened? There are strange marks all over it...&lt;page&gt;I do so love a mystery...And who knows what other marvels lie even deeper below us...
1. DREAM_QUEENSTATION
    > Even those great stags bowed to Hallownest&#39;s King. What devotion he must have inspired.
1. QUIRREL_MINES_1
    > Ahh, quite a view, no?&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m not surprised you survived the trek through these shimmering caverns.&lt;page&gt;There&#39;s an air of strength about you. I suspect it would be quite intimidating, if not for your small stature.
1. QUIRREL_MINES_2
    > Did it sadden you to see those miners below, still labouring at their endless task?&lt;page&gt;Even overcome, strong purpose has been imprinted upon their husks.&lt;page&gt;The crystal ore is said to contain a sort of energy, not as powerful as the soul the city dwellers harnessed but far less lethal.&lt;page&gt;...Strange to know such ancient facts. I wonder from where my knowledge comes?
1. QUIRREL_MINES_3
    > At this high vantage I can just make it out, the light from that sad little town.&lt;page&gt;I doubt its residents could even comprehend the scale of the world that surrounds them.
1. QUIRREL_MINES_4
    > So small it seems...
1. QUIRREL_TEACHER_2
    > Do not hesitate. The choice to reform was hers, not mine.&lt;page&gt;She knows what you would do and seems to welcome it. 
1. QUIRREL_TEACHER_3
    > The Madam&#39;s life is extinguished and with it her seal breaks.&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s a heavy thing you attempt, but I&#39;ve seen your prowess up close and she too believed you capable.&lt;page&gt;Be on your journey then, and allow me rest a time. With the deed complete, I begin to feel my age.
1. QUIRREL_MANTIS_01
    > Hello again! I suppose you&#39;ve already met with the tribe of this village, hmm? They seem a little distrustful of strangers... to put it lightly.&lt;page&gt;They&#39;re not brutes though, no. The sickness in the air that clouds the mind of lesser beasts... they resist it. They retain their intellect and their honour, though also their lethal traditions.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve some words of advice, my friend. If you plan to challenge the lords of this tribe, your blunted nail may prove inadequate.&lt;page&gt;There is a city nearby, the old capital of Hallownest. I&#39;ve heard a Nailsmith resides there. Seek the old bug out and you may find progress that much easier.
1. QUIRREL_SPA_REPEAT
    > Why not join me for a time? These waters do wonders for weary legs. 
1. QUIRREL_TEMPLE_3
    > Unused
1. QUIRREL_RUINS_1
    > The capital lies before us my friend. What a sombre place it seems and one that holds the answers to many a mystery.&lt;page&gt;I too have felt the pull of this place, though now I sit before it I find myself hesitant to descend.&lt;page&gt;Is it fear I wonder, or something else that holds me back?   
1. QUIRREL_RUINS_2
    > The city looks to be built into an enormous cavern, and the rain pours down from cracks in the stone above.&lt;page&gt;There must be a lot of water up there somewhere. I suppose, if the cave roof stayed strong this long, it should hold for us.&lt;page&gt;Before I leave this Kingdom, I&#39;d like to see where all that water comes from. What a sight it must be!
1. QUIRREL_RUINS_3
    > If you look down from here, through the rain, you can just make out those twisted sentries, their husks still stuck in endless patrol.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;d be cautious around them my short friend. Their training will not have been forgotten. This city presents some formidable foes.
1. QUIRREL_RUINS_4
    > Isn&#39;t this a wonderful spot for a rest? I so love the sound of the rain upon glass.
1. QUIRREL_TEMPLE_2
    > Unused
1. QUIRREL_TEMPLE_4
    > To persevere in this ruin, that old nail alone just won&#39;t be enough. Though that&#39;s no problem! One only has to look around.&lt;page&gt;Plenty have come before us and most have met their grisly end, many more equipped than you and I.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m sure they wouldn&#39;t mind were a fellow explorer to relieve them of their tools. It&#39;s a kindness really. The dead shouldn&#39;t be burdened with such things.
1. QUIRREL_TEMPLE_5
    > Did you pass that town above? What a gloomy little place. And such majesty hidden right beneath!&lt;page&gt;I suppose that&#39;s why they&#39;ve all headed down here. Who could resist such possibilities?
1. QUIRREL_TEMPLE_6
    > Truly a marvel...
1. QUIRREL_TEMPLE_1
    > For so long I&#39;ve felt drawn here. So many tales full of wonders and horrors. No longer could I resist. I just had to see it for myself.&lt;page&gt;And what a time I chose to arrive! This dead world has sprung to life.&lt;page&gt;The creatures are riled up and the earth rumbles. The air is thick. I wonder what could have brought it all about?
1. DREAM_MINES
    > ...These winds cry lonely. Better the comfort of rock above one&#39;s head. 
1. DREAM_SPA
    > This one too must seek the village at the nest&#39;s heart. What mystery the purpose that sees it share my path.
1. QUIRREL_QUEENSTATION_REPEAT
    > Is it that, just faintly, you can still hear the echo of the bells?
1. QUIRREL_FOGCANYON_A
    > Doesn&#39;t this kingdom just abound with surprises? A building atop an acid lake.&lt;page&gt;Despite the sight, I can&#39;t help but feel... familiarity? Something stirs in my mind, though I can&#39;t yet tell what..&lt;page&gt;I&#39;d thought it my lust for discovery that led me here but now there seems something else.&lt;page&gt;This building beckons me.
1. QUIRREL_FOGCANYON_B
    > I can feel it calling... Dare I head in? 
1. QUIRREL_SPA
    > Hello, hello! What a thrill this is, to find such warm comfort amidst the den of beasts.&lt;page&gt;This is a ferocious place no doubt. Supposedly, there&#39;s a village deep in the warren. Its inhabitants never accepted Hallownest&#39;s King.
1. DREAM_LAKE
    > To live an age, yet remember so little... Perhaps I should be thankful?&lt;page&gt;All tragedy erased. I see only wonders...
1. QUIRREL_GREENPATH_REPEAT
    > Hallownest is perfect for vigilant explorers like us. So tense and thrilling. In this place, you&#39;re either alert or you&#39;re dead.
1. QUIRREL_EPILOGUE_A
    > Again we meet, my short friend. Here at last, I feel at peace.&lt;page&gt;Twice I&#39;ve seen this world and though my service may have stripped the first experience from me, I&#39;m thankful I could witness its beauty again.&lt;page&gt;Hallownest is a vast and wondrous thing, but with as many wonders as it holds, I&#39;ve seen none quite so intriguing as you.&lt;page&gt;Ha. My flattery returns only silent stoicism. I like that.&lt;page&gt;I like that very much.
1. QUIRREL_EPILOGUE_B
    > ...Incredible...
1. QUIRREL_MANTIS_REPEAT
    > My own route takes me towards that great city. If you search out the Nailsmith, it may not be long until our paths cross again.
1. QUIRREL_TEACHER_HESITATE

1. DREAM_SLUGSHRINE

    > Gone out to clear my head. Will be back soon. If you have something you absolutely must sell, come find me in Fountain Square.
1. RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_1
    > A Wanderer&#39;s Journal, eh?&lt;page&gt;Though they&#39;re common finds about the kingdom, I much enjoy the deciphering of their text.&lt;page&gt;Read together they paint a morbid tale. It seems fate was unkind to most who travel within Hallownest&#39;s ruin.
1. RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_2
    > Another Wanderer&#39;s Journal?&lt;page&gt;I might not offer a lot for each but they&#39;re plentiful about the caverns and I doubt you&#39;ll find another willing to make trade for Geo.
1. RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_3
    > A Wanderer&#39;s Journal? Yes. Yes. I&#39;ll add it to the pile with the others.&lt;page&gt;I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll get to decipher this one. It&#39;s long hard work translating the many languages of the bugs that explore these caverns.
1. RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_4
    > A Wanderer&#39;s Journal?&lt;page&gt;You&#39;ve a knack for finding these. Corpses must be frequent on your journey. No doubt your nail&#39;s created many more.
1. RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_5
    > Another Wanderer&#39;s Journal, eh?&lt;page&gt;This journal is of traditional stone type. Text endures well upon it.&lt;page&gt;In its declining age, this city switched from stone to parchment woven of spider&#39;s silk.&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s a small tragedy, but the moisture in these towers has rendered most of those texts illegible. 
1. RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_6
    > A Wanderer&#39;s Journal?&lt;page&gt;Have you heard that saying about stone journals?&lt;page&gt;If danger lurks close by and your nail has dulled with wear,&lt;br&gt;Just swing your journal at your foes with blunt and deadly flair.&lt;page&gt;S&#39;a good one isn&#39;t it! And accurate. They sure have a heft to them.
1. RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_7
    > What&#39;s that? A Wanderer&#39;s Journal?&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve so many of these now. Once I get around to deciphering them all, I&#39;ll be the preeminent scholar on Hallownest&#39;s dead.
1. RELICDEALER_CONVO_1
    > No touching the antiques! My stock is not for sale.&lt;page&gt;Still, if you&#39;ve managed to come upon any interesting trinkets during your travels, I may be willing to trade. Step over to the counter here and I&#39;ll see what you&#39;ve got.
1. RELICDEALER_SEAL_4
    > Another Hallownest Seal?&lt;page&gt;Others have told me there&#39;s a statue out by the city&#39;s entrance depicting a large knightly figure. Could be one of the Kingdom&#39;s great five.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;d have looked it over myself, but the gate&#39;s long been shut tight and it&#39;s too much hassle taking the long way round with all those blasted husks about.
1. RELICDEALER_SEAL_5
    > Yep, that&#39;s another Hallownest Seal alright.&lt;page&gt;The shop&#39;ll be overflowing with these things soon. Gah! I&#39;d never guessed so many would still be lying around.&lt;page&gt;If they&#39;re as common as you make them seem, maybe I&#39;ve been offering too much for them?
1. RELICDEALER_SEAL_6
    > Another Hallownest Seal? Pass it over then.
1. RELICDEALER_SEAL_7
    > A Hallownest Seal?&lt;page&gt;You&#39;re a talented collector, alright. The best I&#39;ve met. If you keep at it, I worry I&#39;ll run out of space in the shop!
1. RELICDEALER_DREAM_FOUNTAIN
    > ...Who were you mystery knight?... Why no mention beyond your fountain?..
1. RELICDEALER_IDOL_1
    > A King&#39;s Idol, eh?&lt;page&gt;Hallownest&#39;s king was an elusive figure, deified by the citizens. With the king rarely seen, worship was offered through these idols.&lt;page&gt;There&#39;s an expert craft to them. Few alive could match this skill.
1. RELICDEALER_IDOL_2
    > A King&#39;s Idol?&lt;page&gt;If you look closely, each of these idols is subtly different. There are fine engravings about them that take some time to decipher.&lt;page&gt;I suspect each was tailored to the owner. A personalised symbol of the king&#39;s omnipotence.
1. RELICDEALER_IDOL_3
    > Another King&#39;s Idol?&lt;page&gt;Have you visited the remnants of his palace? It&#39;s down below this city, in the bedrock of the kingdom.&lt;page&gt;Must&#39;ve been an impressive sight in its time. Now there&#39;s nothing left.&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s a strange thing though. There are no signs of conflict around the area. It&#39;s as though the whole place just vanished. 
1. RELICDEALER_IDOL_4
    > A King&#39;s Idol?&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve often wondered the true visage of the king. Depictions are of an imposing, gleaming figure and a fiercely horned crown.&lt;page&gt;I suspect there&#39;s much embellishment in the imagery though. A ruler seeking worship tends to hide their blemishes. It&#39;d do no good to appear a common bug.
1. RELICDEALER_IDOL_5
    > A King&#39;s Idol?&lt;page&gt;With as many of these as you&#39;ve delivered, the other Relic Seekers are like to think I&#39;ve gone mad for the King!&lt;page&gt;Pah! Who am I kidding. They&#39;ll only be jealous of my collection. Find me more!
1. RELICDEALER_NO_RELICS_2
    > Not carrying any relics with you? Go find some for me. I&#39;ll pay good Geo for nice items.
1. RELICDEALER_FOUNTAIN_REPEAT
    > I&#39;ll be getting back to the shop soon. If I stay out here too long I&#39;ll get washed into the Waterways.&lt;page&gt;Come and visit if you like. If you have relics, I mean. I&#39;m not much for chatter.
1. RELICDEALER_SHOP_INTRO
    > Aye Aye. Come searching for rare items have you? Well hands off! This collection is mine and I won&#39;t be selling to grubby little wanderers.&lt;page&gt;Still, I imagine you come across many interesting items in your travels. Maybe you&#39;d care to part with some? I&#39;ll offer a fair trade for each.
1. RELICDEALER_SEAL_1
    > A Hallownest Seal, eh? Very interesting this.&lt;page&gt;Do you know of the Kingdom&#39;s five great knights? They&#39;re revered figures of Hallownest, often mentioned in the annals of the Kingdom, but only as a group.&lt;page&gt;Both their names and appearance seem to have been expunged from history.&lt;page&gt;So long has passed since their time. It&#39;d be a grand achievement to discover their identities.
1. RELICDEALER_SEAL_2
    > Another Hallownest Seal? Pass it over.&lt;page&gt;Ah. I enjoy collecting their like, but there&#39;s little information to be gleaned of each.&lt;page&gt;Mind you, they do keep a nice shine about them and there&#39;s nothing wrong with appreciating something purely on aesthetic merits.
1. RELICDEALER_NO_RELICS
    > Hm. Looks like you don&#39;t have any relics on you. If you manage to find any in good condition, bring them to me and I&#39;ll give you a fair amount of Geo for them.
1. RELICDEALER_DREAM
    > ...This short one&#39;s got an odd look about it... though vaguely familiar?..
1. RELICDEALER_DUNG
    > Urgh! What do you think you&#39;re doing, coming into my nice little shop stinking like that?!&lt;page&gt;These relics have been through enough. They don&#39;t need you spreading your stench all over them! Crawl back to the Waterways or wherever you came from!
1. RELICDEALER_TALK_REPEAT
    > We&#39;ve talked enough I think. Relics need cleaning. Texts need deciphering. Out with you! This isn&#39;t a museum.
1. RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_8
    > A Wanderer&#39;s Journal?&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s quite incredible how many of these you&#39;ve collected. You must have travelled the breadth of the kingdom to accrue such a haul.
1. RELICDEALER_EGG_1
    > An Arcane Egg, eh? Now this, this is an ancient thing. These relics are the prize of my profession. There&#39;s knowledge hidden within, though it&#39;s very difficult, painstaking work to extract.&lt;page&gt;One large understanding can be gleaned though. This civilisation may claim itself the first, but something else did exist within this place before Hallownest.&lt;page&gt;Each egg offers a narrow glimpse into that forgotten age.
1. RELICDEALER_EGG_2
    > Another Arcane Egg?&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s a rare chance to own two of these. I&#39;ll be the envy of all my colleagues, though my purse is feeling much lighter for it.&lt;page&gt;These eggs are the most desired find from time before Hallownest, but they&#39;re not the only remnant of that age.&lt;page&gt;You may have come upon them, those old statues that seem a store for soul? They too prove its existence, though in a larger, cruder form. 
1. RELICDEALER_EGG_3
    > A third Arcane Egg? You&#39;re an exceptional explorer to have found so many.&lt;page&gt;An egg is a perfect protective form. In Hallownest we use stone journals or tablets, our text engraved atop. These eggs are far more secure. Their records are stored within.&lt;page&gt;In fear of damaging the eggs, I&#39;m only able to access the outer layer, but it&#39;s clear those in the distant past could somehow access information stored even deeper within.&lt;page&gt;If only I could find a way to do so. Just think of the discoveries to be made!
1. RELICDEALER_EGG_4
    > A fourth Arcane Egg! I wouldn&#39;t have believed it possible. I&#39;ve never met a bug with your knack for uncovering this Kingdom&#39;s treasures.&lt;page&gt;You must have some sort of sense about you? Or maybe these eggs are somehow drawn to you.&lt;page&gt;My fellows have claimed there&#39;s a will of sorts within each egg, that each seeks its own bearer, or reject them.&lt;page&gt;That&#39;d be a subtle power indeed, and I remain sceptical. Relic Seekers are prone to confusing facts with fable.

    > There&#39;s a forgotten history hidden in this kingdom&#39;s antiques, though few seem willing to look. Others come just to claw away at the cracks and ruins.&lt;page&gt;Pah! Scavengers and thieves. It&#39;s contemptible.
1. RELICDEALER_SEAL_3
    > A Hallownest Seal, eh? Give it here.&lt;page&gt;Do you have anything else for me? If not, get your damp little self out of my home.
1. RELICDEALER_TALK_2
    > Admiring my shop are you? Well I&#39;m no squatter.&lt;page&gt;This place was dead empty when I moved in and there&#39;s no one left alive who&#39;d lay claim to the tower.&lt;page&gt;If you fancy yourself a domicile in the city, go find somewhere else, preferably in another building.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m well content with just my relics. I&#39;m not after neighbours.
1. RELICDEALER_NAILSMITH
    > That nail you bear looks mighty blunt. There&#39;re cracks all through it. It&#39;s as much a relic as the objects in my shop!&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve little interest in weapons myself, but it may be an idea to hunt down that old Nailsmith.&lt;page&gt;His hut&#39;s on the outskirts of the city. Not that far from here. He might help add some sting to your weapon, provided he&#39;s feeling generous.  
1. RELICDEALER_FOUNTAIN
    > Oh? What are you doing out in this miserable downpour?&lt;page&gt;Impressive fountain isn&#39;t it? I&#39;m sure we&#39;d be able to appreciate it more if we weren&#39;t both getting drenched.&lt;page&gt;That knight up there was an important one. The plaque here mentions its &#39;sacrifice,&#39; which carries something of an ominous tone.&lt;page&gt;Probably met some sort of horrible end, though it sounds like the knight&#39;s goal may have been achieved in the process&lt;page&gt;In all the relics I&#39;ve collected, I&#39;ve yet to find a clue as to what that was.

1. SHAMAN_MEET
    > Oho! Who is that creeping out of the darkness? My, you&#39;re looking grim! A strange, empty face and a wicked looking weapon!&lt;page&gt;Something important has drawn you down into Hallownest&#39;s corpse, but I won&#39;t ask what. Perhaps the reason you&#39;ve found me is because you need my help?&lt;page&gt;Say no more, friend. I&#39;m going to give you a gift, a nasty little spell of my own creation. It&#39;s just perfect for a little one like you! Ohoho!
1. SHAMAN_OPENED_GATE
    > Why do you hesitate? You&#39;ll get nothing more from me, I&#39;m afraid.&lt;page&gt;Though I do admire your persistence! Ohohohoho! 
1. SHAMAN_SCREAM
    > Pried a spell out&#39;ve my larger cousin did you? Aren&#39;t you the charming one.&lt;page&gt;She&#39;s not usually the generous sort, certainly not as giving as myself, but she does have that wonderful voice! It&#39;s no surprise her spells take on such aural force. 
1. SHAMAN_FUNG_DREAM
    > ...Hear...me...
1. SHAMAN_TRAPPED_1
    > Oho? You&#39;ve woken at last! I apologise, perhaps I should have warned you about the power of that spell. I was watching over you as you slept, but seem to have slipped away myself! Ohohoho!&lt;page&gt;Now we&#39;re awake, I was wondering whether you would do me a small favour. Not as repayment for my gift of course, simply because we&#39;re now friends.&lt;page&gt;You see, a horrid great beast has made its home in the heart of this temple. Such disrespect! I would be quite grateful if you were to venture deeper in and slay it for me.&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s a hardy creature, but with your new power you&#39;re more than a match for it! Good luck with this small favour, my friend! Ohohohohohoho!
1. SHAMAN_OPEN_GATE
    > And look! The gate between us has opened. Ohoho!&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m sure you&#39;re eager to move on. Farewell, and have faith! Whatever you are seeking... it will find you! Ohohoho!
1. SHAMAN_DREAM
    > Poking around in the dreams of others... You&#39;re more curious than you look! Oho ho ho ho!
1. SHAMAN_SUMMONED_2
    > Oho, you&#39;ve come back! Didn&#39;t you like the look of my gift? You left without saying a word!&lt;page&gt;Perhaps you&#39;re braver than you think! Go ahead and take what belongs to you!
1. SHAMAN_CRYSTAL_DREAM
    > ...Free...me...
1. SHAMAN_QUAKE
    > Ah ho! I&#39;m sensing new power about you, one that&#39;ll crack the rock beneath us. A useful thing for one looking to travel ever deeper.&lt;page&gt;My third uncle used to possess similar abilities. He also possessed a ferocious temper! Ohohoho! What a dreadful combination. 
1. SHAMAN_RETURN
    > Oho! What brings you back through here, little shadow? Are you lost?&lt;page&gt;Don&#39;t worry about me. I don&#39;t need anything more from you. Ohohoho!
1. SHAMAN_KILLED_BLOCKER_1
    > Oho! So it&#39;s done then, you&#39;ve slain the beast!&lt;page&gt;The poor thing! It must have been terrified of you. It used to be quite docile, but the rancid air in these caverns filled it with some ancient rage.&lt;page&gt;Still, you did what had to be done! You have my gratitude! Of course, we both know you wouldn&#39;t have made it through without that spell of mine... Ohoho!
1. SHAMAN_KILLED_BLOCKER_2
    > Oho! There you are! I was watching over you while you slept, and must have slipped away myself. I woke up and found you&#39;d disappeared! You are a surprising one, ohoho!&lt;page&gt;Actually, I wanted to ask a small favour of you. You see, there is a certain creature lurking just above us, in the heart of this temple...&lt;page&gt;...Oho? Well, yet another surprise! You&#39;ve slain that creature before I&#39;ve even asked!&lt;page&gt;I scarcely deserve such a friend as you! You&#39;re a marvel! Ohohoho!
1. SHAMAN_FUNG
    > A corpse overgrown with vegetation.
1. SHAMAN_QUAKE2
    > My friend. My friend. There&#39;s another quality about you yet. You didn&#39;t perchance visit my fourth aunt?&lt;page&gt;She makes her home beside that Crystal Mount. Leaves quite an impression on those that seek her out. Were I not bound here, I&#39;d love to visit myself.
1. SHAMAN_FIREBALL2
    > What&#39;s this? My vengeful gift has warped within you. You&#39;ve twisted it into something... else.&lt;page&gt;Ohohohoh! I knew it. My friend! You&#39;re a marvel. Your essence has melded with the spell.&lt;page&gt;You must have found a powerful source to transform it in such a unique, expressive way.
1. SHAMAN_SUMMONED_1
    > Don&#39;t be afraid. Have faith! That spell belongs to you now, all you need to do is take it!&lt;page&gt;Ohohoho, you won&#39;t be going much further without it, I promise you!
1. SHAMAN_SCREAM2
    > That scream? Ooohh, distorted in such a way... It&#39;s not within the skills of us snails to do such a thing.&lt;page&gt;Wherever you draw this new power from, it&#39;s not a place my kind ever thought to look.
1. SHAMAN_TRAPPED_2
    > What is it? Are you wondering about this gate between us? Ohoho! It&#39;s a curious thing, but this door will not open until you have slain that creature lying in the heart of the temple.&lt;page&gt;Don&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;m sure the spirits of my ancestors will be watching over you.

### Sly

1. SLY_RESCUE_2
    > Oh! What?! Who are you?!&lt;page&gt;...I see. This old village. What a strange dream, to have led me down here! If you hadn&#39;t found me, I don&#39;t think I would&#39;ve ever woken.
1. SLY_RESCUE_3
    > I&#39;m Sly. Usually, I live an uneventful life up in Dirtmouth. The air in these ruins doesn&#39;t agree with me, so I&#39;d best be getting back.&lt;page&gt;If you return above, come and see me. I&#39;m probably the friendliest face left there, and I can thank you properly for your good deed.
1. SLY_SHOP_INTRO
    > Ah, hello! I knew we&#39;d meet again. How do you like my cosy little store? I&#39;ve made myself pretty comfortable here, selling old trinkets to travellers like yourself.&lt;page&gt;If you&#39;re planning a trip below, I&#39;ve several items that may improve your chance of survival.
1. SLY_BASEMENT_1
    > ...So, another would join our group.
1. SLY_BASEMENT_2
    > I have a gift for you, warrior. As a shopkeeper, I admit parting with it for free is rather difficult.&lt;page&gt;But as the Great Nailsage I must recognise your skill. You have mastered the arts of my remaining pupils. Now tradition decrees you too may hold the symbol.
1. SLY_BASEMENT_3
    > Wear it proudly, Nailmaster. You shall be the last to receive its like.
1. SLY_GENERIC
    > Pockets feeling empty? If you need some more Geo, take a trip into the ruins below us and hunt around. Just take care not to fall into a haze. I won&#39;t be coming down to rescue you.
1. SLY_KEY_2
    > What do you have there? Why, that&#39;s the key to my storeroom! I thought I&#39;d lost it for good.&lt;page&gt;Hmm? Did you find it in those old mines perhaps? Very curious. I&#39;ve no idea how it ended up in such a remote place.&lt;page&gt;Very honest of you to return it to me, yes. Very kind. And now that I can open my old storeroom up, I can sell you some of the rare stock that&#39;s been gathering dust in there.&lt;page&gt;These items may be a little time-worn, but they still retain their full market value. Very precious stuff! Take a look... 
1. SLY_RESCUE_1
    > ...ugghh, Oro you oaf.... You wield your nail... like a club...&lt;page&gt;...Esmy... how much deeper do we have to go...
1. SLY_GENERIC_NM
    > How are your travels, Nailmaster? As time goes by, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll only grow stronger.&lt;page&gt;If you see your fellow Nailmasters again, tell them I carry them in my thoughts always. And that they should come and buy something from their old teacher as a mark of respect.
1. SLY_NAILART
    > Hmm, you seem a little different. Something has changed in your bearing.&lt;page&gt;Ah! The way you hold your nail! So you&#39;ve learnt a Nail Art...&lt;page&gt;Very interesting. I wonder, do you have the passion to continue your training?
1. SLY_DREAM_STORE
    > ...Wherever you are... Whatever it is you do now... I hope you three are looking after yourselves...
1. SLY_NOSTOCK_2
    > Back again? You know I haven&#39;t any stock left, yes? You&#39;ve cleaned me out.&lt;page&gt;Or were you hoping to sneak a peek at my mountain of Geo? Well it&#39;s mine now! And fairly traded. 
1. SLY_KEY
    > What do you have there? Why, that&#39;s the key to my storeroom! I thought I&#39;d lost it for good.&lt;page&gt;Hmm? Did you find it in those old mines perhaps? Very curious. I&#39;ve no idea how it ended up in such a remote place.&lt;page&gt;Very honest of you to return it to me, yes. Very kind. And now that I can open my old storeroom up, I can sell you some of the rare stock that&#39;s been gathering dust in there.&lt;page&gt;These items may be a little time-worn, but they still retain their full market value. Very precious stuff! Take a look... 
1. SLY_MAPPER
    > I see they&#39;ve opened that mapping shop across the way. I suppose a little competition is healthy.&lt;page&gt;Perhaps I should start to sell maps as well... or is that a little aggressive? Heh. All&#39;s fair in a world made of Geo.
1. SLY_NAIL_HONED
    > You&#39;ve found a new nail, then? It looks like a much finer weapon than the last.&lt;page&gt;Hmm? Oh, this is the same nail... but it&#39;s been honed! By someone extremely skilled...&lt;page&gt;A nail is an extension of ourselves, it is the instrument by which we shape the world around us. It&#39;s a sacred duty to keep its edges sharp.&lt;page&gt;...Heh, sorry. I shouldn&#39;t ramble on like that. Let&#39;s talk Geo instead.
1. SLY_BASEMENT_REPEAT
    > Off you go Nailmaster. I&#39;ve nothing more to give you...&lt;page&gt;Nothing for free at least. I&#39;ll be up briefly and eager take your Geo in trade for my precious wares.
1. SLY_DREAM_BASEMENT
    > ...These refined weapons...The battles of Geo are much deadlier...
1. SLY_RESCUE_REPEAT
    > You&#39;re exploring then? Very brave! Plenty of courageous wanderers have been lost to the hunger of these old caverns.&lt;page&gt;You have your nail though, and I can tell just by looking that you know how to wield it.
1. SLY_DREAM_RUINS
    > ...Geo. Geo. All the world is Geo. No nail can withstand its might...
1. SLY_NOSTOCK_1
    > Ah, still looking for something to buy? Is your Geo weighing you down? Unfortunately, you seem to have cleared out everything I&#39;d be willing to part with. Nothing left at all!&lt;page&gt;I think there might be a few old trinkets down in my storeroom, but I lost the key a while ago.&lt;page&gt;So, no more business between us I&#39;m afraid! For now at least. Get out of here and let me spend some quality time with all the Geo you&#39;ve gifted me.

### Stag

1. STAG_TOWN
    > This place... we are near the surface, I believe? There is a town here. You should take the opportunity to rest.&lt;page&gt;This place was once full of travellers coming and going. It seems much quieter now.
1. STAG_GREENPATH
    > My, this place is much changed since I last saw it. The greenery grows so wild the station&#39;s like to be consumed by it.
1. STAG_HOPE_2
    > Yes, I will hold onto that hope. My kin, still alive, still out there, journeying beyond these lands.&lt;page&gt;But for me, I could never abandon the stagways. Not as long as passengers still need them.&lt;page&gt;I can tell you still have important work to do. I will be your companion as long as my old body still serves.&lt;page&gt;Let us enjoy the old stagways of this kingdom together a little longer.
1. STAG_END_SPEAK
    > Eager to travel the stagways? Just hop upon that platform, give me the signal and we&#39;ll soon be on our way.
1. STAG_NEST
    > Being back in my old home... I feel the weight of my long life bearing down on me.&lt;page&gt;I carry it proudly, though. Wherever I travel, the memories of my family and my kind come with me.
1. STAG_ROYALGARDENS
    > Before you rang the bell, I&#39;d almost forgotten this station existed. It was not often used by the common bugs, being a well-guarded retreat for our late Queen.&lt;page&gt;Even as overgrown as they&#39;ve become, these gardens are still beautiful after all this time. I&#39;m sure the Queen would be happy to know that.
1. STAG_RUINS2
    > Little one, we stand in the King&#39;s Station! Named of course for the King of Hallownest, he who ordered the building of the stagways and stations.&lt;page&gt;The King never rode the stagways himself, but I&#39;ve heard he was a glorious bug to behold, bright and radiant in visage, so much so it hurt to look at him.
1. STAG_MEET
    > Greetings, little one! It&#39;s been an age since I last heard the ringing of a station bell. It echoed down the stagways and called me to you.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve grown stiff and tired over these many years and I&#39;ve forgotten much, but the sound of the bell will always call me back.&lt;page&gt;These stagways stretch the depths of Hallownest. If you want to travel them, hail me from the platform. I will take you where you need to go.
1. STAG_DEEPNEST
    > Ahh, little one... Where are we? I have never been to this station. It has a strange air of danger to it. Let me take you somewhere safer, quickly.
1. STAG_TRAVEL_1
    > Ready to go, little one?
1. STAG_RESTINGGROUNDS
    > The Resting Grounds... Passengers would come here to conduct rituals for those who had passed on.&lt;page&gt;Not any more though. Perhaps the dead conduct their own rituals now?
1. STAG_TRAM
    > That pass you hold! Is it not for that ghastly machine, the tram? I hope you&#39;re not thinking of riding on that grotesque contraption.&lt;page&gt;The thought a mere machine could attempt what we stags do! Foolish...Very foolish.
1. STAG_CROSSROADS
    > It was a long time ago, but I remember when these highways and crossroads pulsed with life. These are the paths I first carried passengers through when I was young.&lt;page&gt;Those travellers are long gone, yet still I remain. Now it seems it&#39;s just you and I and the furtive creatures scratching and squirming all around us.
1. STAG_EGG_INSPECT
    > An empty eggshell.
1. STAG_FUNGUS
    > Ahh, this gladdens me. The Queen&#39;s Station has opened once more. This place was a bustling hub of travel, well-placed for travellers visiting the outer edges of the land.&lt;page&gt;You&#39;re quite the explorer to find this place.
1. STAG_HOPE_1
    > What do you think of my old home, little one?&lt;page&gt;It was full of life, once. Stags coming and going, swapping stories of the places they&#39;d been and the passengers they&#39;d met.&lt;page&gt;For a long time now, I&#39;ve considered myself the only one remaining. The last stag.&lt;page&gt;But being in the Nest again... there&#39;s something in the air. A smell, or a warmth, or a presence perhaps?&lt;page&gt;Could it be, other stags have made their way out into the wider world?
1. STAG_FLOWER_WARNING
    > That flower you&#39;re carrying... It looks quite beautiful, but also very delicate. I fear if you travel with me it will be ruined.&lt;page&gt;If you need to keep it intact, I&#39;d suggest using your own legs to carry it to its destination.
1. STAG_DREAM
    > I tire so easily now, and my old legs seem to ache more and more. Still, I&#39;m lucky to grow old at all... so many others haven&#39;t.
1. STAG_REMEMBER_1
    > You&#39;ve opened several stag stations now, haven&#39;t you? I&#39;m thankful for the opportunity to once more travel through the kingdom.&lt;page&gt;As I visit more places I feel my memories returning to me, like the stagways of my mind are running once more.&lt;page&gt;Continue to open the stations and you&#39;ll have my deepest gratitude.
1. STAG_REMEMBER_2
    > Ahh, many stag stations have been opened. Again I can travel the breadth of the kingdom. So many grand thoroughfares and old sideways I&#39;d forgotten.&lt;page&gt;Somewhere amongst the lines lies the Stag Nest, the place where I was born and raised. I&#39;d thought its location lost to my failing mind, but now I can almost remember the path.&lt;page&gt;If you keep opening stag stations and beckoning me through them, perhaps I&#39;ll again find that Nest. Ahh, I would like that very much!
1. STAG_REMEMBER_3
    > Little one! I&#39;ve found it! the Stag Nest, where I was born and raised.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve yet to go there again. My duty binds me to travel only where I am called, but if you wished to see it yourself, I could take you there.&lt;page&gt;None may remain to welcome us, but the nest is still a sight to behold! Give me the word, and we will go there at once.
1. STAG_RUINS1
    > I remember this station well. A common trip it was. Goods from all over the kingdom were transported here.&lt;page&gt;Not a lot was sent back the other way though.
1. STAG_HIDDEN
    > Ah! What station is this, hidden all the way at the bottom of the world?&lt;page&gt;Until I heard the bell calling, I didn&#39;t even know the Stagways travelled so deep. You&#39;ve discovered something quite astounding, little one!&lt;page&gt;No matter how old I grow, the world still keeps surprises like this stowed away...
1. STAG_TISO
    > I see another takes rest upon the bench. There&#39;s something unpleasant about that one, but a stag station&#39;s doors are open to all.&lt;page&gt;If he requests passage, I&#39;ll offer it gladly. My duty as a stag far outweighs any personal distaste.

1. PRECEPT_13
    > Precept Thirteen: &#39;Never Be Afraid&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Fear can only hold you back. Facing your fears can be a tremendous effort. Therefore, you should just not be afraid in the first place.
1. PRECEPT_14
    > Precept Fourteen: &#39;Respect Your Superiors&#39;.&lt;page&gt;If someone is your superior in strength or intellect or both, you need to show them your respect. Don&#39;t ignore them or laugh at them.
1. PRECEPT_15
    > Precept Fifteen: &#39;One Foe, One Blow&#39;.&lt;page&gt;You should only use a single blow to defeat an enemy. Any more is a waste. Also, by counting your blows as you fight, you&#39;ll know how many foes you&#39;ve defeated.
1. PRECEPT_16
    > Precept Sixteen: &#39;Don&#39;t Hesitate&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Once you&#39;ve made a decision, carry it out and don&#39;t look back. You&#39;ll achieve much more this way.
1. PRECEPT_17
    > Precept Seventeen: &#39;Believe In Your Strength&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Others may doubt you, but there&#39;s someone you can always trust. Yourself. Make sure to believe in your own strength, and you will never falter.
1. PRECEPT_18
    > Precept Eighteen: &#39;Seek Truth in the Darkness&#39;.&lt;page&gt;This precept also explains itself.
1. PRECEPT_19
    > Precept Nineteen: &#39;If You Try, Succeed&#39;.&lt;page&gt;If you&#39;re going to attempt something, make sure you achieve it. If you do not succeed, then you have actually failed! Avoid this at all costs.
1. PRECEPT_7
    > Precept Seven: &#39;Mourn Not the Dead&#39;.&lt;page&gt;When we die, do things get better for us or worse? There&#39;s no way to tell, so we shouldn&#39;t bother mourning. Or celebrating for that matter.
1. PRECEPT_8
    > Precept Eight: &#39;Travel Alone&#39;.&lt;page&gt;You can rely on nobody, and nobody will always be loyal. Therefore, nobody should be your constant companion.
1. PRECEPT_1
    > ... but that&#39;s not the only danger I had to overcome in my quest for glory! You&#39;ve noticed this trophy, haven&#39;t you? A keepsake from my final, triumphant battle deep in the pit below us.&lt;page&gt;Yes, &#39;Life Ender&#39; claimed another victim, and the crowd erupted into ecstatic cheering. Cheering that was both loud and utterly sincere.&lt;page&gt;To what do I owe my long string of triumphs and victories, you ask? As I said earlier, the key is in my personal philosophy, the &#39;Fifty-Seven Precepts of Zote&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Particularly relevant here is the first precept: &#39;Always Win Your Battles&#39;. As for the other fifty-six precepts? Well...
1. PRECEPT_2
    > Precept Two: &#39;Never Let Them Laugh at You&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Fools laugh at everything, even at their superiors. But beware, laughter isn&#39;t harmless! Laughter spreads like a disease, and soon everyone is laughing at you.&lt;page&gt;You need to strike at the source of this perverse merriment quickly to stop it from spreading.
1. PRECEPT_3
    > Precept Three: &#39;Always Be Rested&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Fighting and adventuring take their toll on your body. When you rest, your body strengthens and repairs itself. The longer you rest, the stronger you become.
1. PRECEPT_4
    > Precept Four: &#39;Forget Your Past&#39;.&lt;page&gt;The past is painful, and thinking about your past can only bring you misery. Think about something else instead, such as the future, or some food.
1. PRECEPT_5
    > Precept Five: &#39;Strength Beats Strength&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Is your opponent strong? No matter! Simply overcome their strength with even more strength, and they&#39;ll soon be defeated.
1. PRECEPT_55
    > Precept Fifty-Five: &#39;Bow to No-one&#39;.&lt;page&gt;There are those in this world who would impose their will on others. They claim ownership over your food, your land, your body, and even your thoughts!&lt;page&gt;They have done nothing to earn these things. Never bow to them, and make sure to disobey their commands.
1. PRECEPT_56
    > Precept Fifty-Six: &#39;Do Not Dream&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Dreams are dangerous things. Strange ideas, not your own, can worm their way into your mind. But if you resist those ideas, sickness will wrack your body! Best not to dream at all, like me.
1. PRECEPT_57
    > Precept Fifty-Seven: &#39;Obey All Precepts&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Most importantly, you must commit all of these precepts to memory and obey them all unfailingly. Including this one!&lt;page&gt;Hmm. Have you truly listened to everything I&#39;ve said? Let&#39;s start again and repeat the &#39;Fifty-Seven Precepts of Zote&#39;.
1. PRECEPT_9
    > Precept Nine: &#39;Keep Your Home Tidy&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Your home is where you keep your most prized possession - yourself. Therefore, you should make an effort to keep it nice and clean.
1. PRECEPT_50
    > Precept Fifty: &#39;Don&#39;t Linger on Mysteries&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Some things in this world appear to us as puzzles. Or enigmas. If the meaning behind something is not immediately evident though, don&#39;t waste any time thinking about it. Just move on.
1. PRECEPT_51
    > Precept Fifty-One: &#39;Nothing is Harmless&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Given the chance, everything in this world will hurt you. Friends, foes, monsters, uneven paths. Be suspicious of them all.
1. PRECEPT_52
    > Precept Fifty-Two: &#39;Beware the Jealousy of Fathers&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Fathers believe that because they created us we must serve them and never exceed their capabilities. If you wish to forge your own path, you must vanquish your father. Or simply abandon him.
1. PRECEPT_53
    > Precept Fifty-Three: &#39;Do Not Steal the Desires of Others&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Every creature keeps their desires locked up inside of themselves. If you catch a glimpse of another&#39;s desires, resist the urge to claim them as your own. It will not lead you to happiness.
1. PRECEPT_54
    > Precept Fifty-Four: &#39;If You Lock Something Away, Keep the Key&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Nothing should be locked away for ever, so hold onto your keys. You will eventually return and unlock everything you hid away.
1. PRECEPT_20
    > Precept Twenty: &#39;Speak Only the Truth&#39;.&lt;page&gt;When speaking to someone, it is courteous and also efficient to speak truthfully. Beware though that speaking truthfully may make you enemies. This is something you&#39;ll have to bear.
1. PRECEPT_21
    > Precept Twenty-One: &#39;Be Aware of Your Surroundings&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Don&#39;t just walk along staring at the ground! You need to look up every so often, to make sure nothing takes you by surprise.
1. PRECEPT_22
    > Precept Twenty-Two: &#39;Abandon the Nest&#39;.&lt;page&gt;As soon as I could, I left my birthplace and made my way out into the world. Do not linger in the nest. There is nothing for you there.
1. PRECEPT_23
    > Precept Twenty-Three: &#39;Identify the Foe&#39;s Weak Point&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Every foe you encounter has a weak point, such as a crack in their shell or being asleep. You must constantly be alert and scrutinising your enemy to detect their weakness!
1. PRECEPT_24
    > Precept Twenty-Four: &#39;Strike the Foe&#39;s Weak Point&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Once you have identified your foe&#39;s weak point as per the previous precept, strike it. This will instantly destroy them.
1. PRECEPT_25
    > Precept Twenty-Five: &#39;Protect Your Own Weak Point&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Be aware that your foe will try to identify your weak point, so you must protect it. The best protection? Never having a weak point in the first place.
1. PRECEPT_26
    > Precept Twenty-Six: &#39;Don&#39;t Trust Your Reflection&#39;.&lt;page&gt;When peering at certain shining surfaces, you may see a copy of your own face. The face will mimic your movements and seems similar to your own, but I don&#39;t think it can be trusted.
1. PRECEPT_27
    > Precept Twenty-Seven: &#39;Eat As Much As You Can&#39;.&lt;page&gt;When having a meal, eat as much as you possibly can. This gives you extra energy, and means you can eat less frequently.
1. PRECEPT_28
    > Precept Twenty-Eight: &#39;Don&#39;t Peer Into the Darkness&#39;.&lt;page&gt;If you peer into the darkness and can&#39;t see anything for too long, your mind will start to linger over old memories. Memories are to be avoided, as per Precept Four.
1. PRECEPT_29
    > Precept Twenty-Nine: &#39;Develop Your Sense of Direction&#39;.&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s easy to get lost when travelling through winding, twisting caverns. Having a good sense of direction is like having a magical map inside of your head. Very useful.
1. ZOTE_DREAM_FINAL
    > I came to this kingdom to fulfill a promise... and now I have succeeded!&lt;page&gt;That promise I made so long ago... A promise to myself...&lt;page&gt;A promise of glory! Glory for I, Zote the Mighty! I never doubted myself, never faltered, and now I have achieved everything I desired.
1. ZOTE_DREAM_DEEPNEST
    > So, the kingdom was hiding this dark nest full of deadly predators. Well, now the deadliest predator of all is here...&lt;page&gt;...Zote the Mighty!
1. ZOTE_TOWN_REPEAT
    > Hmph. What a squalid little hamlet this is.The air is foul and the townsfolk have beady eyes. I&#39;ll be heading back down below as soon as possible.
1. ZOTE_CITY_EXTRA
    > I suppose you&#39;re impressed by how tall the towers are here. Hmph. I&#39;ve seen much taller towers in my travels. Much nicer, too.
1. ZOTE_COLOSSEUM_REPEAT
    > Leave me be, you lowly worm! I must rest before my great battle. Pray we do not meet in the arena...
1. PRECEPT_6
    > Precept Six: &#39;Choose Your Own Fate&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Our elders teach that our fate is chosen for us before we are even born. I disagree.
1. DREAM_COL_CORPSE
    > Go on, cur! Scurry away! Lest I humiliate you further!
1. ZOTE_COLOSSEUM_GREET
    > I have been fighting my whole life. I&#39;ve slain hundreds, nay thousands, of foes.&lt;page&gt;And these fools think to face me in combat? Madness! It seems they&#39;ve been gripped by a powerful desire to be destroyed.&lt;page&gt;Very well then. Zote the Mighty will grant them their desire...
1. PRECEPT_30
    > Precept Thirty: &#39;Never Accept a Promise&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Spurn the promises of others, as they are always broken. Promises of love or betrothal are to be avoided especially.
1. PRECEPT_31
    > Precept Thirty-One: &#39;Disease Lives Inside of Dirt&#39;.&lt;page&gt;You&#39;ll get sick if you spend too much time in filthy places. If you are staying in someone else&#39;s home, demand the highest level of cleanliness from your host.
1. PRECEPT_32
    > Precept Thirty-Two: &#39;Names Have Power&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Names have power, and so to name something is to grant it power. I myself named my nail &#39;Life Ender&#39;. Do not steal the name I came up with! Invent your own!
1. PRECEPT_33
    > Precept Thirty-Three: &#39;Show the Enemy No Respect&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Being gallant to your enemies is no virtue! If someone opposes you, they don&#39;t deserve respect or kindness or mercy.
1. PRECEPT_34
    > Precept Thirty-Four: &#39;Don&#39;t Eat Immediately Before Sleeping&#39;.&lt;page&gt;This can cause restlessness and indigestion. It&#39;s just common sense.
1. PRECEPT_35
    > Precept Thirty-Five: &#39;Up is Up, Down is Down&#39;.&lt;page&gt;If you fall over in the darkness, it can be easy to lose your bearing and forget which way is up. Keep this precept in mind!
1. PRECEPT_36
    > Precept Thirty-Six: &#39;Eggshells are brittle&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Once again, this precept explains itself.
1. PRECEPT_37
    > Precept Thirty-Seven: &#39;Borrow, But Do Not Lend&#39;.&lt;page&gt;If you lend and are repayed, you gain nothing. If you borrow but do not repay, you gain everything.
1. PRECEPT_38
    > Precept Thirty-Eight: &#39;Beware the Mysterious Force&#39;.&lt;page&gt;A mysterious force bears down on us from above, pushing us downwards. If you spend too long in the air, the force will crush you against the ground and destroy you. Beware!
1. PRECEPT_39
    > Precept Thirty-Nine: &#39;Eat Quickly and Drink Slowly&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Your body is a delicate thing and you must fuel it with great deliberation. Food must go in as fast as possible, but fluids at a slower rate.
1. ZOTE_DREAM_CITY
    > Why does the air weep? Is this kingdom trying to mock me? I shed my last tear long ago...
1. ZOTE_DREAM_COLOSSEUM
    > How miserable, to be stuck here instead of continuing my quest...&lt;page&gt;I came to this kingdom to fulfill a promise... and that is what I will do...
1. ZOTE_TOWN_1
    > You there! Why are you skulking about in the shadows?&lt;page&gt;Yes, your eyes do not deceive you. I am Zote the Mighty, a knight of great renown. Tremble before me!&lt;page&gt;While you were hiding here in your dingy little village, I ventured into the dark pit below us and slew a great beast. It had sharp mandibles and atrocious manners.&lt;page&gt;Yes, yes. All glory to me. But I don&#39;t have time for your adulation! I must rest and prepare for my next journey down.
1. PRECEPT_1_R
    > Precept One: &#39;Always Win Your Battles&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Losing a battle earns you nothing and teaches you nothing. Win your battles, or don&#39;t engage in them at all!
1. ZOTE_DREAM_TOWN1
    > This dreary place... it reminds me of home. How ghastly...
1. ZOTE_BUZZER_1_B
    > Know this, cur. I am Zote the Mighty, a knight of great renown. Cross me again, and you&#39;ll find out why they call my weapon &#39;Life Ender&#39;.
1. ZOTE_DREAM_BUZZER
    > Foolish beast... you dulled your mandibles by gnawing on my indestructible body. No wonder you were defeated by this weakling!
1. ZOTE_CITY_GREET
    > Hoy! Watch where you&#39;re going, you soggy vagabond! I don&#39;t want you splashing me. I&#39;ve had a miserable time trying to keep dry.&lt;page&gt;I am Zote the Mighty, a knight of great renown. If I decide that I&#39;m going to stay dry, then that&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen!&lt;page&gt;Curse this wretched city! Water and monsters constantly fall from above! It&#39;s no wonder this blasted kingdom fell to ruin...
1. ZOTE_CITY_REPEAT
    > Have you seen them? The guards who still patrol this city, even after dying?&lt;page&gt;Hmph. Being overly devoted to one&#39;s duties is no virtue.
1. ZOTE_COLOSSEUM_MEET
    > Hmm? What do you want, cur? Have you come to laugh at me as well?&lt;page&gt;Fools! Did you never consider that being trapped in this cage was precisely what I intended?!&lt;page&gt;Yes, by all means, release me into your arena!&lt;page&gt;I am Zote the Mighty! And as soon as I draw my nail, &#39;Life Ender&#39;, your laughter will turn into terror!
1. ZOTE_BUZZER_1
    > Just what do you think you&#39;re doing?! You dare to come between me and my prey? Is it a habit of yours to scurry about, getting in the way and causing bother?
1. ZOTE_BUZZER_2
    > What are you still bothering me for? I&#39;m a Knight. I&#39;m not interested in your childish games. I need my rest.&lt;page&gt;Begone! Lest I draw my nail...
1. PRECEPT_40
    > Precept Forty: &#39;Obey No Law But Your Own&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Laws written by others may inconvenience you or be a burden. Let your own desires be the only law.
1. PRECEPT_41
    > Precept Forty-One: &#39;Learn to Detect Lies&#39;.&lt;page&gt;When others speak, they usually lie. Scrutinise and question them relentlessly until they reveal their deceit.
1. PRECEPT_42
    > Precept Forty-Two: &#39;Spend Geo When You Have It&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Some will cling onto their Geo, even taking it into the dirt with them when they die. It is better to spend it when you can, so you can enjoy various things in life.
1. PRECEPT_43
    > Precept Forty-Three: &#39;Never Forgive&#39;.&lt;page&gt;If someone asks forgiveness of you, for instance a brother of yours, always deny it. That brother, or whoever it is, doesn&#39;t deserve such a thing.
1. PRECEPT_44
    > Precept Forty-Four: &#39;You Can Not Breathe Water&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Water is refreshing, but if you try to breathe it you are in for a nasty shock.
1. PRECEPT_45
    > Precept Forty-Five: &#39;One Thing Is Not Another&#39;.&lt;page&gt;This one should be obvious, but I&#39;ve had others try to argue that one thing, which is clearly what it is and not something else, is actually some other thing, which it isn&#39;t. Stay on your guard!
1. PRECEPT_46
    > Precept Forty-Six: &#39;The World is Smaller Than You Think&#39;.&lt;page&gt;When young, you tend to think that the world is vast, huge, gigantic. It&#39;s only natural. Unfortunately, it&#39;s actually quite a lot smaller than that. I can say this, now having travelled everywhere in the land.
1. PRECEPT_47
    > Precept Forty-Seven: &#39;Make Your Own Weapon&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Only you know exactly what is needed in your weapon. I myself fashioned &#39;Life Ender&#39; from shellwood at a young age. It has never failed me. Nor I it.
1. PRECEPT_48
    > Precept Forty-Eight: &#39;Be Careful With Fire&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Fire is a type of hot spirit that dances about recklessly. It can warm you and provide light, but it will also singe your shell if it gets too close.
1. PRECEPT_49
    > Precept Forty-Nine: &#39;Statues are Meaningless&#39;.&lt;page&gt;Do not honour them! No one has ever made a statue of you or I, so why should we pay them any attention?
1. ZOTE_DEEPNEST_1
    > Hoy! What are you doing, you clumsy little oaf?! Swinging your rusty little nail around in the darkness?&lt;page&gt;You almost struck me! And if you had, it would have been the end of you. Trust me!&lt;page&gt;I am Zote the Mighty, a knight of great renown. My weapon, &#39;Life Ender,&#39; has struck down hundreds of foes. Begone, or you&#39;ll be next!
1. ZOTE_DEEPNEST_2
    > Hmm? Are you lost in these dark tunnels? I don&#39;t care.&lt;page&gt;No, I won&#39;t lead you out. I know the way, due to my powerful memory, but I only travel alone. Begone.
1. ZOTE_TOWN_2
    > That daft old fellow over there... He keeps talking absolute drivel. Seems to think the very air is deadly down in the caverns. Perhaps he should consider not breathing.&lt;page&gt;He keeps talking about dreams, too. Pfah! Dreams are for those too feeble to truly live.
1. PRECEPT_10
    > Precept Ten: &#39;Keep Your Weapon Sharp&#39;.&lt;page&gt;I make sure that my weapon, &#39;Life Ender&#39;, is kept well-sharpened at all times. This makes it much easier to cut things.
1. PRECEPT_11
    > Precept Eleven: &#39;Mothers Will Always Betray You&#39;.&lt;page&gt;This precept explains itself.
1. PRECEPT_12
    > Precept Twelve: &#39;Keep Your Cloak Dry&#39;.&lt;page&gt;If your cloak gets wet, dry it as soon as you can. Wearing wet cloaks is unpleasant, and can lead to illness.

    > The moth tribe were (perhaps) descended from Radiance. However, the King convinced them somehow to seal Radiance away. I guess so he could rule Hallownest with his singular vision, as a monarch/god with no other gods.The moths sealed Radiance away by forgetting about her. Hallownest was born and flourished. However, the memory of Radiance lingered (eg the statue at hallownest&#39;s crown) and soon she began to reappear in dreams and starting exerting influence. The King and the bugs of hallownest resisted this memory/power and it started to manifest as the infection. Thus the first attempt to seal Radiance failed, and the King had to try another method - the Vessel.

    > This little shadow...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Must return to its darkness.
1. To live forever in an unchanging world... Death, I would fear less.
1. Only one path I see. The Seals must break. Will it bring destruction? Of course. It will bring change, too. Let it.&lt;page&gt;To live forever in an unchanging world... Death, I would fear less.
1. Remember our promise, sister!&lt;br&gt;We three vowed to protect the seal with all of our devotion.
1. HEGEMOL_CONVO_3
    > My child...For you, I would give it all.
1. What calls it from beyond the Seal?&lt;br&gt;The Vessel, or that captive light?
1. &lt;br&gt;As you say... we made a promise. Let it be done.
1. Unused Below
1. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remember our bond... our sacrifice. For the kingdom&#39;s sake... for the one we must protect.

1. Go no further, little shadow.
1. How long has passed? How long have we slept?
1. DREAMERS_EC2_1A_2
1. To sleep eternal, what difference from death?
1. LURIEN_CONVO_3
    > My city. Do you sustain without me? Do you thrive? I would see your streets again...
1. That plague, it calls to something within. But that union it offers is a lie, the cost, a mind regressed.
1. For diversity. For variance. For evolution. I become bond upon the Vessel.
1. My mind is seal upon that tragic being. But who shall teach them now? Who shall open their minds, where I cannot?
1. This little shadow...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Must return to its darkness.
Fade away, little shadow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fade away, and allow us sleep in peace.
1. DREAMERS_EC1_1A
1. It matters not. Our Seals remain. This shadow seeks to defy us... It must be cast away.
1. Talks about her history: As part of the agreement for her alliance and her role as a dreamer, King gave her a child (Hornet). Was she allowed to keep this child or was she taken away?

1. Our King appears as bug, and I shall take him as so.But his are traits that transcend our kind. His is a mind beyond ours. Deity given form.In sleep, I shall not look upon his like again.
1. We sealed that plague, and thought we&#39;d found an answer, but we were wrong.&lt;page&gt;Our sacrifices... what did they win us? A world sealed in stasis.
1. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Open your minds, brother and sister.&lt;br&gt;Our vow was to protect...but do we? The Vessel weakens.
1. What compels you to claw your way out of the darkness? What compels your return to this sacred kingdom?
1. For my daughter and my kind, I become bond upon the Vessel.

1. More detached than the other dreamers? Maybe ponders how the Hollow Knight (vessel) feels after all this time. Would he make the same choice again?First few 1. dialogues are very taciturn

    > Our sacred Hallownest... It was so old. An eternal, undying kingdom... unchanging.&lt;page&gt;They called me &#39;Teacher&#39;, but what did I have left to teach? What did I have left to learn?
1. MONOMON_CONVO_3
    > When the light came, we feared it. Of course we did! So we fought to keep things as they were.&lt;page&gt;Our sacrifices... what did they win us? Simply another kind of stasis.

    > is it always capitalised. Should it be? Currently inconsistent in the text.
1. Wood to Shellwood
    > Doesn&#39;t come up much, but this is probably what Zote&#39;s Nail is made from. Also what the beams in the mines are made from.
1. night
1. hour
    > No specific time is ever perceptible. Enforces the idea of a world in stasis. &#39;An age ago&#39; is okay. 
1. Day, today
    > remove anything this specific about time.
1. Monarch
1. Knight
    > Are knights a special term in the kingdom? so only the hollow knight and the five king&#39;s knights are referred to as &#39;Knight&#39;. All others eg mage knights, royal guards should no tbe referred to as &#39;knights&#39;
1. Blade
    > Can be used if directly connected to a weapon ie a nail&#39;s blade.
1. person, people
1. seal, seals
    > do a check for the pluralisation here. There is one seal (around the hollow knight, that includes the binding spells, the chains, the dreamers and the egg). Each of the dreamers is part of that seal, not &#39;A&#39; seal. &lt;&lt;&lt;this is no longer accurate. I ended up pluralising seals. It became too difficult otherwise -Ari.
1. but, though
    > check Ari hasn&#39;t used these too much as well and replace where possible/necessary.
1. Clothes
    > Cloak is okay. Otherwise the bugs wear no clothes.
1. human
1. today
    > no days. its one long night
1. Sword
1. day, year
1. Magic
    > spell is used, but magic in Hollow Knight is generally a shamanistic thing, so the words around it are more &#39;will&#39; &#39;spirit&#39; &#39;force&#39; and emotions like &#39;rage&#39; &#39;vengeance&#39; &#39;longing&#39; etc. Maybe magic can be used?
1. money? 
    > probably should be just geo. but could say the kingdom&#39;s currency.
1. Geo
    > is Geo capitalised? Should it be?
1. lady, man
    > is lady okay? Check its usage. As a royal thing maybe? Or maybe better to avoid it completely.
1. book
    > not sure if these exist? Likely not. Journals exist. Tablets exist. Parchment exists. Journals look like they&#39;re made of stone. the relic dealer references parchment made from spider silk, but its not common.
1. Fingers
1. British to American english
    > Hollow Knight uses British English. Run a spell check. Channelled, not Channeled.
1. Hands
    > Few creatures have hands. Avoid it if possible.
1. SOUL and soul
    > in UI text it should be SOUL in full caps, as seen on the first Tut tab. Currently inconsistent.
1. Species not race
    > do a find and manual replace for each of these.
1. hot spa hot spring
    > probably go with spring over spa. Is spa a man made thing? spas are man-made, but the spas in this game do seem as though they&#39;ve been constructed. wither term is fine though
1. Journal Pluralisation
    > THis should be consistent. Most follow this formula, but not all: standard note is singluar.Hunter&#39;s note speaks to the species normally, but can be either, because it&#39;s more casual.
1. Bretta White Saviour
    > To obscure the knight&#39;s gender in this instance, White Prince should probably be replaced with White Saviour.
1. tree
    > no trees in hallownest, only roots, leaves and plants.
1. dressed
    > check for it. can be used in special instances, but not a common word/
1. gender notes
    > the hollow knights have no gender. Check for hims and hes. Is the Wyrm King gendered? probably. or is it that when the wyrm took king form it gained a gender?Hornet is the Gendered Child. She can be referred to as female.
