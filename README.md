# Hollow Knight Compendium

I've taken the datamined Hollow Knight dialogue files and put them in a markdown file for reference.

## Steps to Datamine (Windows 10)
1. Download [UtinyRipper](https://github.com/mafaca/UtinyRipper)
2. Locate Hollow Knight's game folder (e.g. *C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Hollow Knight*)
3. Drag and drop game folder into UtinyRipper's gui, wait for import to complete
4. Export datamined files to somewhere on your machine
5. Locate the language folder *hollow_knight\Assets\Resources\languages*
6. Open the .byte files in your favourite text editor (e.g. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
   - Ignore .byte.meta files
   - For english dialogue, find files starting with EN_ (e.g 'EN_Achievements')
